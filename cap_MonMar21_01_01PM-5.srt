1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,558
- The last line, um, patients.

2
00:00:04,558 --> 00:00:07,395
So there's a few different options.

3
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:10,476
The Orlistat, so Alli if
it's over the counter,

4
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:15,476
Xenical, um, Belviq is an option.

5
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:16,751
And then I just put some of the,

6
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:18,947
um, the ADR's here.

7
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:22,321
So headache, dizziness,
potential hypoglycemia.

8
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:25,208
Qsymia is a newer medicine,

9
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:27,927
so the Phentermine and Topiramate.

10
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,978
Um, and same type of symptoms,

11
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:33,952
dizziness, headache, insomnia.

12
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:38,057
And then we want to talk about

13
00:00:38,057 --> 00:00:40,601
healthy diet and exercise, as we said.

14
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,001
Other complications...

15
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,188
Oh I forgot to mention
arthritis is a huge one.

16
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:47,564
I actually had a patient in
this morning before I came here,

17
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,963
she was 419 pounds, and
was just complaining

18
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:52,856
that all her joints hurt,
and she's on Diclofenac,

19
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:54,921
and she's tried all these NSAIDS,

20
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,725
and when it comes down to it,

21
00:00:56,725 --> 00:00:59,604
I mean, she's having arthritic
pain from being 420 pounds,

22
00:00:59,604 --> 00:01:02,157
so, um, really that's gonna
be your first time option,

23
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,263
is to lose the weight.

24
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:07,685
Sleep apnea, so people
with large neck radiuses.

25
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:12,516
Depression goes hand in hand, usually.

26
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:15,527
And no to the bariatric surgery.

27
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:21,667
So let's say this patient
was a 31 year old female,

28
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,567
would there be any weight loss medications

29
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:26,065
you would not want to give her?

30
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:31,765
The same thing with our Statins, right?

31
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:35,274
What are we thinking about
with a 31 year old female?

32
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:37,156
Pregnancy, yep.

33
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,385
OK, we lost that one.

34
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,405
Um, Belviq you shouldn't use, sorry.

35
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:01,990
I don't know where that slide went.

36
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,470
Um, in pregnant patients.

37
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,231
So again, it depends on the BMI,

38
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:11,555
but pregnant patients, if...

39
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:15,467
If the obesity is not a severe
extreme, immediate issue,

40
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:17,596
I would just do lifestyle modification,

41
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,298
and then worry about pharmacotherapy

42
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:23,479
after the baby, after they've
lost some of the baby weight.

43
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,641
If they're pregnant.

44
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:29,975
OK, so this patient was started on Belviq,

45
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,949
10 milligrams twice a day,

46
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:34,802
he's been eating healthy and exercising,

47
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:35,920
and he's kind of concerned that

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,122
he hasn't lost a lot of weight.

49
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:42,702
So he's lost some, 194 to 188.

50
00:02:42,702 --> 00:02:44,625
What would you recommend?

51
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:59,154
OK, so 150 minutes a week exercise,

52
00:02:59,154 --> 00:03:01,101
that's one point.

53
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:04,872
What about the medicine?

54
00:03:04,872 --> 00:03:08,054
Would you keep him on
the same medicine, no?

55
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:08,718
I have one no.

56
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:10,747
Would you switch the medicine?

57
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:14,560
One yes.

58
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,746
OK, um, so after three months,

59
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:23,234
you want to reevaluate about
five percent of the body weight

60
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:27,071
you can initiate a different
agent at that point.

61
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:30,291
If that's still a route
you want to pursue.

62
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,175
Um, if they've kind of come down,

63
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:34,141
their BMI's down less than 30,

64
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:38,233
you might just want to try,
trial DC-ing it altogether.

65
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,929
So some general recommendations
from the guidelines,

66
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:47,893
they are very straightforward.

67
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:50,818
Um, calculate the BMI,

68
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:52,925
you know, you're worried
about risk for CVD,

69
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:57,307
diabetes, um, measuring
waist circumference.

70
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:00,665
Three to five percent of weight loss

71
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:03,488
results in clinically
meaningful reductions

72
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:05,500
in a lot of things, so your sugars,

73
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,998
your triglycerides, your blood pressure,

74
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:08,714
and it really does.

75
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:11,861
I've seen patients just lose,
you know, 10 to 20 pounds,

76
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:13,865
and all of a sudden their blood
pressure is under control,

77
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,418
sugars are under control.

78
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,813
It's amazing, watching it happen.

79
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:20,283
Um, weight loss diet,

80
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:23,154
so for women about 1200 to 1500,

81
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:26,521
for men 1500 to 1800.

82
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:29,427
Stupid men, get extra calories.

83
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:32,921
Um... (laughs)

84
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,406
That's my own thought,
not in the guidelines.

85
00:04:37,196 --> 00:04:39,876
Um, let's see.

86
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:42,040
OK, and again, um,

87
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,624
bariatric surgery is only for BMI over 40,

88
00:04:44,624 --> 00:04:47,770
or over 35 with comoribid conditions,

89
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,595
who haven't responded to pharmacotherapy

90
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:52,301
or other treatment options.

91
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,707
And then...

92
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:58,220
I just made this chart so you can see, um,

93
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,372
the main dosage and side effects.

94
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:01,348
You guys can read through that.

95
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:05,727
But I did want to show
you, I liked one slide.

96
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:13,395
So, some conditions that
you might want to consider

97
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:15,778
starting different
obesity medications with.

98
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:19,981
So CVD or uncontrolled, hypertension, um,

99
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:22,065
you might want to lean more towards

100
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:25,359
the Lorcaserin or Orlistat.

101
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,513
Depression, possibly
maybe lean more towards

102
00:05:28,513 --> 00:05:30,318
the Bupropion and Naltrexone,

103
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:33,299
because of that Bupropion agent.

104
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,756
Um, migrane, possibly
Phentermine Topiramate

105
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:39,016
because of the Topiramate component.

106
00:05:39,016 --> 00:05:42,545
Seizure, if the patient
has a history of seizures,

107
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:43,498
you might want to make sure that

108
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:45,787
you avoid the Bupropion
just like you would

109
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:48,959
smoking cessation, or depression.

110
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,038
And possible first choice,
Phentermine or Topiramate,

111
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:54,452
again from that Topiramate component.

112
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,346
So, if you just kind of are clueless,

113
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:58,867
and the patient has one
of these other conditions,

114
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:01,135
you could consider starting
one of these agents,

115
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:01,881
because of that.

116
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:02,733
Yes?

117
00:06:09,986 --> 00:06:12,842
Do smoking cessation with this product?

118
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:19,171
Oh, yeah.

119
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:23,070
Yeah, if you're using it...

120
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,734
Yes, if you're using it
for the obesity first,

121
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:28,123
and you also want them to
have smoking cessation,

122
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:29,516
you definitely can use that product,

123
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:32,668
because it has that Bupropion
in it, yes, good point.

124
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:35,484
Does anyone have any questions on obesity?

125
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:37,774
It's really stratightforward, but...

126
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:41,489
Hypertension questions,
dyslipidemia questions?

127
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:43,369
OK, hopefully that was helpful.

128
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,088
Have a good day, guys.
