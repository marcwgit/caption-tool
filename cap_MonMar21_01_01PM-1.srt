1
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:09,355
- (laughs) He's a little shrimp.

2
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:11,324
I'm betting that would be 140.

3
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:15,563
Nothing.

4
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:16,778
Not a thing.

5
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:06,494
Okay, so does anybody wanna take a guess

6
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:07,963
what they would start?

7
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:11,120
ACE inhibitor, okay.

8
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:14,751
That's right.

9
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:18,820
Let's go back to the patient.

10
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,723
42 year old white male.

11
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:22,866
So you always wanna look at the age first.

12
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:28,456
Patients that are younger than 75

13
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,116
are gonna be

14
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:34,149
less than 140 over 90 is their goal.

15
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:36,483
So you wanna make sure
you know their goal.

16
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:38,763
If they're older and
they have a co-morbidity,

17
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:41,677
same goal, less than 140 over 90.

18
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:44,164
So that's always for the
most part gonna be your goal.

19
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,627
Next thing you wanna look
at is their ethnicity

20
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:51,414
because JNCA have
different recommendations

21
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:55,767
for African Americans versus Caucasians.

22
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:59,378
Now, African Americans, first line.

23
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:00,957
If they have no other disease states,

24
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,453
this is where some people
get a little bit confused

25
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:05,833
is gonna be a calcium channel blocker

26
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,772
and we're talking about
the dihydropyridine,

27
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:10,292
or a thiazide-like diuretic.

28
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,788
ACEs and ARBs are second line.

29
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:17,176
But if they are diabetic or
have chronic kidney disease

30
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:20,577
then ACEs or ARBs would
be recommended first line.

31
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:21,848
Does everybody understand that point

32
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:24,222
'cause I think people get
confused sometimes with that.

33
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:30,288
So the next thing you wanna look at,

34
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:33,945
well, you wanna hope your
patient's not 14 pounds.

35
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,768
Look at past medical history.

36
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:39,237
So we do have some other
co-morbidities going on.

37
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:41,712
Dyslipidemia and Type II diabetes.

38
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:44,138
So Type II diabetes, I
agree with whoever said

39
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:46,473
ACE or ARB, that would
be my first thought.

40
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:48,707
You wanna make sure your
patients are on that.

41
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:53,172
And dyslipidemia doesn't
have a direct response

42
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,250
to what agent you would choose,

43
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,817
but it's just good to know that they have

44
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,901
increased cardiovascular risk.

45
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:04,015
So vitals, 163 over 95,
definitely elevated,

46
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:07,358
to their goal of less than 140 over 90.

47
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:10,348
And then heart rate's always
important to look at too.

48
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,440
If you have a patient
with a heart rate over 100

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,193
you might wanna think maybe
they need a beta blocker

50
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:20,037
if they're consistently having
a really elevated pulse.

51
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:21,762
Maybe they need some rate control.

52
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,215
Labs, these are just some labs.

53
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:28,727
You do always wanna take
into consideration potassium.

54
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:31,937
Somebody said ACE inhibitor.

55
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:33,737
Do we know what the goal potassium is?

56
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:35,403
Most hospitals?

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,498
3.5 to 5.

58
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,019
So this one's just slightly elevated,

59
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,517
kind of on the border,

60
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:42,119
not something we would clinically

61
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,940
be worried about the patient having

62
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,310
any real issues.

63
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,516
But you may not want to initiate

64
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:51,094
an ACE or an ARB in this patient because

65
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:53,253
their potassium's already elevated.

66
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:55,802
ACEs and ARBs can increase potassium.

67
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,578
You always want to assess smoking,

68
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:02,959
drinking, illicit drugs, diet.

69
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,310
And we'll get some of
our cases will have that.

70
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:08,137
So what's the appropriate therapy?

71
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:11,178
Well first line in the
JNCA you're going to

72
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,455
automatically have for Caucasian patient

73
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,380
ACE, ARB, calcium channel blocker,

74
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,377
or thiazide-like diuretic.

75
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:21,263
So that's mostly
hydrochlorothiazide chlorthalidone.

76
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:26,295
You kind of maybe would
rule out the ACE or the ARB

77
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:28,066
because of their potassium.

78
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,519
And then you have the
calcium channel blocker

79
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,241
or the HCTZ, either of which
would be a good option.

80
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:42,851
Usually we start the ACTZ at 12.5

81
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,277
and then we'll titrate from there.

82
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:48,179
You wanna make sure that
you counsel dizziness,

83
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:52,058
always hypotension with
the thiazide-like diuretics

84
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,857
as a possibility.

85
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:55,598
Smaller possibility than beta blockers

86
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:57,491
but still a possibility.

87
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:59,314
You're gonna wanna monitor labs

88
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:03,110
particularly potassium, maybe sodium.

89
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,036
I have seen cases where the
sodium actually goes low.

90
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,003
We remove the HCTZ and it bumped back up.

91
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,506
Counseling points, counsel
on general hypotension.

92
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,576
NSAIDs may interfere.

93
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:20,212
And then reevaluate in two to four weeks,

94
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:23,950
that's just gonna be
dependent on clinical use,

95
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,817
so you could say two weeks
would be a fine recommendation,

96
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:29,320
four weeks would be a fine
recommendation as well.

97
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:33,134
Does anybody have any
questions on that case

98
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,508
and kind of the thought process behind it?

99
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:44,279
So now let's say this patient
is an African American male.

100
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,410
Would your recommendations change?

101
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,369
So Berkeley said

102
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:00,371
take off the ACE and ARB which is correct,

103
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,356
which we weren't gonna
do anyways just because

104
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:03,656
of the potassium.

105
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,036
But that's the main difference between

106
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:08,219
Caucasian and African American.

107
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,530
And I wanna stress like I said before

108
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,839
if a patient is African American

109
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,893
and has diabetes or chronic kidney disease

110
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:19,399
they'll still use an ACE
or an ARB as first line

111
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,868
for renal protection.

112
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,179
Okay, next case.

113
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,097
I'll let you guys read through that

114
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:28,763
and give you a couple of minutes.

115
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,230
So does anybody wanna take

116
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,618
a stab at this one?

117
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:25,133
You guys should know
this from case studies

118
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,533
like the back of your hand.

119
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,986
Just nobody wants to talk,
you're in class all morning?

120
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:38,167
DASH diet, okay.

121
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:56,840
Berkeley basically said DASH diet,

122
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,582
so look at total fats.

123
00:07:58,582 --> 00:08:02,466
Generally increase fruits
and vegetables, low fat.

124
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:07,343
Sodium less than 2.3
grams per day ideally.

125
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:10,122
If they're in that higher risk population

126
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:14,250
they've actually recommended
less than 1.5 grams daily.

127
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:19,678
Physical activity try for
about 30 minutes per day,

128
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:23,132
five days per week which will
get you that 150 minutes.

129
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,236
Alcohol intake, women, limit to one drink,

130
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:29,772
men limit to two drinks, that's per day.

131
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:33,040
And then smoking, you
always wanna assess that

132
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,276
each visit if they're willing to stop.

133
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,677
Okay, so next case I'll give
you a minute to read through.

134
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:02,688
What's the answer to this one?

135
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:06,745
Lisinopri, yeah.

136
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:07,988
So, Berkeley already said

137
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:10,066
you'd change it to an ARB which is exactly

138
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:12,132
what happens clinically.

139
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:14,094
They come in and you wanna make sure

140
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:17,589
that you quantify or not quantify,

141
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:20,596
determine what type of
cough they're having.

142
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:23,591
So, it's really gonna
be a hacking dry cough

143
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,913
and a pretty consistent cough.

144
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:29,071
If they're coming in and
they're having deep chest

145
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,973
coughing up mucus,
that's a different thing.

146
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,634
So you always wanna make
sure that you ask them

147
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:35,359
to describe their cough.

148
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:41,053
Again, patient is 71 year
old African American male,

149
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:43,468
so we're looking at there hypertension.

150
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:47,531
It looks to be relatively
controlled on the ACE,

151
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:50,440
so just a switch to an ARB we'd be fine.

152
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:54,207
Losartan for example you would just start

153
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:57,527
at 50 milligrams and then
you'd wanna bring them back in

154
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,535
and reassess if their blood pressure's

155
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,266
controlled at that dose.

156
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,420
You might need to go ahead and bump it up.

157
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:09,625
That was just an example.

158
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,809
Any questions on that one?

159
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,778
If you guys have questions
at all just stop me.

160
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,144
Okay, so this next one.

161
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,908
And what would you guys
wanna do with this one?

162
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,546
George is smiling.

163
00:10:57,848 --> 00:10:59,677
This one's pretty high, right?

164
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:02,783
2010 over 121.

165
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,487
She's already taken her
blood pressure medicine

166
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:06,889
so I wanted to emphasize that point.

167
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:08,063
You always wanna ask have you taken

168
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:09,892
your blood pressure medicine today.

169
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,101
The answer would still be the
same with what you would do

170
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,529
but then you would also advice the patient

171
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,004
to go ahead and take their blood pressure

172
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:18,024
medicines for the day as long as it wasn't

173
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,679
too close to their next dose.

174
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,923
And then you recheck it.

175
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,108
You always wanna do a recheck,

176
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:26,261
make sure the cuff was
sized appropriately.

177
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,345
If there was a manual machine

178
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:30,064
make sure the manual machine's accurate.

179
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,571
You don't wanna just be
giving somebody medicine

180
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,108
if it was an error on the machine's part.

181
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,547
It's still really high.

182
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:43,386
So, she's actually over 180 over 120.

183
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,291
So you wanna think about
hypertensive urgency

184
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,474
or hypertensive emergency.

185
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:52,413
Urgency is not associated with target

186
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:56,803
organ injury.

187
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:59,821
And then hypertensive
emergency you are worried about

188
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:01,900
patients having symptoms.

189
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,920
You're worried about organ injury.

190
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,480
What organs are we mostly
talking about here?

191
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,607
Any heart, brain, right?

192
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,047
So a stroke.

193
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,928
And then you'll have your
peripheral stuff too,

194
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:15,367
so issues with eyes

195
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,763
and peripheral vascular issues.

196
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:23,390
Mostly if you're in an outpatient setting

197
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,733
or if you send them to the emergency room,

198
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,289
so if you're in a retail-type setting

199
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,390
you're not gonna be able
to just give them Clonadine

200
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,563
you're gonna have to call.

201
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:33,908
But what they'll do is
give them Clonadine.

202
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:38,123
Guideline say 0.2 milligrams
as soon as possible

203
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,503
and then you wanna recheck
their blood pressure,

204
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,488
and then you can give 0.1 milligrams

205
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:44,346
each hour after that.

206
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,668
In clinic we'll actually
put them in a dark room,

207
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,874
have them lie down,

208
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:50,731
take the cellphone away type situation,

209
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:52,878
let them calm down if it's

210
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:55,427
something that's elevated due to stress.

211
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,009
Alternatively you can use Labetalol,

212
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,795
and the goal is to reduce
mean arterial pressure

213
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,618
within 24 hours.

214
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:06,730
Also sometimes it's more old school

215
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,516
but you can use Hydralazine
for the same purpose.

216
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:11,792
Clonadiine is gonna be your most commonly

217
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,410
used medicine and the one
you should know about.

218
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,016
You do have to worry about,

219
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:19,431
this isn't a medicine that
we use for hypertension

220
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,672
usually around the clock because

221
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:24,720
it does have really bad
side effects of hypotension

222
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,448
and dizziness, so it's not
good in elderly patients.

223
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:30,968
So try to avoid it just
for hypertension use,

224
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:33,252
but in this situation it's okay.

225
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:34,976
Does anyone have any questions on that?

226
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:41,935
Okay, we kind of already
talked about this one.

227
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,910
I got a little ahead of myself.

228
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,961
Yeah?

229
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:48,606
Captopril?

230
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,184
Clonadine.

231
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:55,787
You could use Labetalol,
you could use Hydralazine,

232
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:58,631
but any emergency
department that you go to,

233
00:13:58,631 --> 00:13:59,938
it's Clonadine.

234
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:03,576
Okay, this patient, this
one's a little bit easier

235
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,131
but I just wanted to
bring this up to discuss,

236
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,878
so we'll take a look at it.

237
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:46,412
What would you guys
wanna do with this one?

238
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:50,365
Okay, Berkeley said it
increases the Amlodipine,

239
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:51,944
and that's exactly right.

240
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:56,112
So I just want it to stress the point that

241
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:58,411
if they're not titrated to the maximum

242
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:00,098
therapeutic effective dose--
