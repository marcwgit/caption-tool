1
00:00:00,759 --> 00:00:04,579
- (mumbling) Most the class.

2
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:06,261
Nothing.

3
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:09,071
Okay, so Welchol actually you want to get

4
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:12,137
baseline lipids because
you can't initiate it

5
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:15,005
with triglycerides over 300.

6
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:18,499
So that's why that's important.

7
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:21,366
For the most part, you're not going to use

8
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:23,619
a bile acid sequestrant in the treatment

9
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,918
of dyslipidemia in general.

10
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:28,240
Statins are going to be our first line.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,746
After that we can add on Zetia.

12
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:36,378
We can add on the new PCSK9 inhibitors,

13
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:38,387
which I'll talk about in a minute.

14
00:00:38,387 --> 00:00:41,869
Niacin, fish oil, and then I would say

15
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:44,275
very last line would be
a bile acid sequestrant.

16
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:45,527
Yes?

17
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,797
Say it one more time, sorry?

18
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:57,002
Besides the statin?

19
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,382
Fish oil probably.

20
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:04,382
I mean, dyslipidemia is kind
of easy because it's statins

21
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:06,708
for the most part.

22
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,321
Welchol can be used and I have used it

23
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:13,569
in patients that are,
can't tolerate statins,

24
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:15,729
can't afford Zetia,

25
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:17,169
then you can use something like this.

26
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:19,259
It does have LDL benefit.

27
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,791
It's hard to take

28
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,425
and then you can't use it
if triglycerides are high

29
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,538
so it's a more difficult drug to use

30
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,581
but it's kind of there for an option

31
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:31,565
if all your other options are not,

32
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:33,899
if you're not able to
use your other options.

33
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:38,021
So again, don't want to use the face line.

34
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:40,214
Trigylcerides are over 300.

35
00:01:40,214 --> 00:01:42,095
Discontinue if they get over 400,

36
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:44,847
because we don't want them to be over 500

37
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:47,711
and then have to treat
that with another drug.

38
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:52,662
And the most common one is, well,

39
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:55,309
Cholestyramine as well, but
Welchol or Cholestyramine

40
00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:59,349
are going to be the most
common ones you see.

41
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,450
Lab values, you guys
already told me these.

42
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,279
It sounds like you know them very well,

43
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,865
so these are just here for you.

44
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:09,509
Less than 200, and these come
from our ATP3 guidelines.

45
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,691
I think, especially your
class might be the class

46
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:13,386
that's going to be the
most confused because

47
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:16,788
they came out with guidelines
while you were in school

48
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:19,365
and nobody knows how to use them.

49
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:20,794
Like, providers don't
know how to use them.

50
00:02:20,794 --> 00:02:22,327
Physicians don't know how to use them

51
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:24,266
because the new guidelines don't even have

52
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,984
cholesterol goals in them.

53
00:02:25,984 --> 00:02:29,351
So what most practitioners
are doing is merging

54
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,993
the ATP3 guidlelines, or the goals,

55
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:35,012
with the new guidelines, so there's still,

56
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:36,834
the other guidelines just basically say,

57
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:39,922
"Start a moderate
intensity statin," the end.

58
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:41,977
Like, there's no need to reach a goal.

59
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:45,541
But most practitioners are using these and

60
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,060
I would assume that the
NAPLEX is what they'll test

61
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,660
you on as well and you know those.

62
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,303
And if Capstone tests
you, it'll be on this.

63
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:59,834
Okay, so in general,
clinical ISDVD patients

64
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:01,541
need to be initiated on statins.

65
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,197
Patients with an LDL over 190

66
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:07,832
and that's just with no comorbidities,

67
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:11,595
if they have diabetes and are 40 to 75,

68
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:14,137
with an LDL between 70 to 189,

69
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,715
they need to be started,
so basically over 70,

70
00:03:16,715 --> 00:03:20,441
70 to 189, and then the
rest captures the 190.

71
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:24,981
Also 40 to 75 with an
LDL between 70 to 189

72
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:28,891
and the 10 year ASCVD risk over 7.5.

73
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,376
So that's when you would start a statin.

74
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:37,441
Of course, contraindicate in
pregnancy like we talked about.

75
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:39,740
Anybody with active liver
disease, you're not going

76
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,026
to want to start a statin.

77
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:44,418
And if they have history of
liver disease, I'd be cautious

78
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:46,519
to start a statin if
there's another option

79
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,018
that you can use.

80
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:50,398
If you are going to start
one, that's when it would be

81
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:52,987
clinically indicated to
check the AST and ALT

82
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:55,785
more frequently when
you pull a lipid panel

83
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,885
and I do have patients
that have liver disease

84
00:03:57,885 --> 00:04:00,742
that are on statins that do fine on them.

85
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,314
It's just I do check their LFTs.

86
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:09,079
Lipid panel, again, four to
12 weeks after initiation,

87
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,041
then every three to 12 months.

88
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:14,035
Usually once they're at
goal on a statin and they're

89
00:04:14,035 --> 00:04:16,380
kind of good, I'll just
bump them to once a year

90
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,725
and make sure that it's
still good once a year.

91
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,364
So high intensity, we have Atorvastatin,

92
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:28,045
40 to 80, and then the
Crestor, moderate intensity

93
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:32,617
Simvastatin, 20 to 40,
80 we don't use any more.

94
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:35,075
And then Atorvastatin,
10 to 20 and low dose

95
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,174
Rosuvastatin and then low intensity,

96
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:39,916
where there's actually,
there's other ones,

97
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,168
Pravastatin, 80 milligrams is moderate

98
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:44,119
intensity as well.

99
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:48,588
Low intensity, there's no real
indication per the guidelines

100
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,040
for low intensity statins.

101
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,827
They either recommend
high intensity or moderate

102
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,244
intensity.

103
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:55,322
Clinically you might see Pravastatin

104
00:04:55,322 --> 00:04:59,145
or Lovastatin because
they're the cheapest.

105
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:01,283
They're the cheapest and then Pravastatin,

106
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:03,779
if there's going to be interactions,

107
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,242
that's the best one to go to.

108
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:09,032
So you could do Pravastatin,
40 to 80 milligrams as well.

109
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:13,345
Main side effects, of
course the myopathy's

110
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:17,628
and myalgia's, elevated
liver enzymes and rabdo,

111
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:19,463
and we talked about all those things.

112
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:22,342
So what to do if they're
having myopathy's,

113
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:24,223
if they're having Rhabdomyolysis.

114
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,796
Hopefully no one has
any questions on that.

115
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,712
Next the fibric acid derivatives, again,

116
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:34,823
Gemfibrozil has that
interaction with statins,

117
00:05:34,823 --> 00:05:37,122
particularly Simvastatin.

118
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:41,046
You want to make sure to try
and avoid that if possible.

119
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:43,462
And Fenofibrate's also another option.

120
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:46,798
It's a more expensive option,
though, if cost is an issue.

121
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:50,601
And then you want to make sure that you

122
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:54,218
same monitoring parameters,
monitor lipid panels.

123
00:05:56,185 --> 00:05:57,683
So I talked a little bit about this,

124
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,181
but I want to talk some more about it,

125
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,004
just so that everybody's clear.

126
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:05,207
So Zetia is usually an add-on
therapy after you've kind of

127
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:10,207
maxed out statins or if the
patient cannot tolerate statins.

128
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,543
So statin plus Zetia or Zetia
if they can't tolerate statins

129
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,139
at all.

130
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:19,290
It has shown benefit, so it
does have a place in therapy.

131
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,843
It's just kind of an add-on
therapy after we've tried that.

132
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:25,959
PCSK9 inhibitors, did your
class have this in IT?

133
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:28,949
Or update? Okay.

134
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:31,527
So pretty new class of drugs,

135
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,048
the monoclonic antibodies.

136
00:06:33,048 --> 00:06:34,906
There's four of them now.

137
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:37,145
There might have only been
two when you had it in IT,

138
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:39,223
but there's four now.

139
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:40,582
I couldn't even tell you
all the names off the top

140
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:42,788
of my head because they're
new and I don't use them

141
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:43,786
in practice.

142
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:45,889
Praluent, they have weird names,

143
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:50,289
but these are for the

144
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:54,351
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

145
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:58,170
That's what they're FDA indicated for.

146
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,170
They also have an indication
if they're on the maximum

147
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,495
statin dose, you can add
one of these on as well.

148
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,200
They're very expensive
agents at this point.

149
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,474
I don't think many
practitioners are utilizing them

150
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,458
frequently unless they have that familial

151
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:18,280
hypercholesterolemia, but
it is an option and it is

152
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,637
FDA approved, so you should
know about those drugs

153
00:07:20,637 --> 00:07:23,875
and then niacin I think
we covered pretty well

154
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,231
but again, it's going to increase the HDL,

155
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,321
lower the triglycerides.

156
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:32,201
Aim-High trial said
there's no real benefit.

157
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:37,100
Other studies kind of differ with that.

158
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,828
It's not in the guidelines
but you might see it used,

159
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:43,485
so if you do see it used, you
want to think about the liver

160
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:46,400
function test and the flushing,

161
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,909
so red flushing.

162
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:50,962
If they do have that, you can
give aspirin or ibuprofen,

163
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:53,093
30 to 60 minutes ahead of time.

164
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:55,995
Okay, any questions on that?

165
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,808
So let's take like really
just a five minute break

166
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:01,975
because there's not much
of the lecture left.

167
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:06,161
That being said, let's
talk about obesity briefly.

168
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:09,944
So obesity's very
straightforward, very simple,

169
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:12,359
but just a refresher on some of the drugs,

170
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,270
when you should use them, et cetera.

171
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,078
So I'll let you read
through that real quick.

172
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:51,904
So we have a 31 year old male, 194 pounds,

173
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:56,826
five foot five, doesn't
exercise, eats a lot of fast food

174
00:08:56,826 --> 00:09:00,123
because he's in pharmacy school.

175
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:02,225
He's noticed some weight
around his abdomen

176
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:05,720
over the last few months, smokes, drinks.

177
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,534
So, calculate a BMI for him.

178
00:09:11,605 --> 00:09:13,736
Hopefully you guys
remember how to do this.

179
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:46,337
Does anybody have one?

180
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:06,750
31.4, anyone get anything different?

181
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,660
I don't know if I, okay.

182
00:10:10,696 --> 00:10:14,691
I have 29, but I could have
typed something in wrong.

183
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,409
So let's go with 29.

184
00:10:16,409 --> 00:10:18,568
So this is just a refresher.

185
00:10:18,568 --> 00:10:21,611
Underweight's going to be less than 18.5.

186
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:24,757
Normal is 18.5 to 24.9.

187
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,427
Overweight's 25 to 29.9.

188
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:32,002
Obese starts at 30,
technically, to 34.9 and

189
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:36,158
then they classify severely
obese as a separate thing,

190
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:39,606
35 to 39.9 and then anything over 40

191
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,522
is going to be morbidly
obese, and that's when

192
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:44,308
bariatric surgery can
be considered and we'll

193
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:45,712
go through that in just a minute.

194
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:49,350
So let's say their BMI's 29.

195
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,090
That's going to put him as overweight.

196
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,558
So what would you start at this point?

197
00:10:56,804 --> 00:10:59,289
I heard a diet and exercise
and that's accurate.

198
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:03,527
So pharmacotherapy is not
indicated until their BMI's

199
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:08,527
over 30 and I'd like to
say that the guidelines,

200
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:10,783
I think sometimes students get confused.

201
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:13,627
It's not if you're BMI's over
30 you automatically start

202
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:16,529
on a pharmacotherapy agent.

203
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:18,921
Pharmacotherapy agents
for obesity are only going

204
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:22,532
to decrease you by about
three to six kilograms,

205
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:25,771
which is approximately
more or less five to 10%

206
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,141
of body weight.

207
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:29,928
Those should only be
initiated after trying diet

208
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:34,363
and exercise lifestyle
changes for about six months

209
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:38,101
with no improvement seen
and then the BMI's over 30

210
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:39,970
and they have comorbidities,
then you can start

211
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,525
a pharmacotherapy agent,
but it's not something

212
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,672
if you're reading a patient
case or if when you're out

213
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:47,784
on rotations you see a
patient has a BMI over 30,

214
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:51,464
we're going to put everybody
in the world on Orlistat

215
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:52,788
or something like that.

216
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:56,166
If that was the case,
most people in America

217
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,163
would be walking around on
some type of anti-obesity

218
00:11:58,163 --> 00:11:59,649
medicine, right?

219
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:00,625
So that's just not the case.

220
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,424
So I want to make sure that that's clear,

221
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:04,351
that when you do see your Capstone cases,

222
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:06,801
you're not trying to start
people on that right away.

223
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,461
First line's always, always going to be

224
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,277
lifestyle recommendations.

225
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:15,531
So, smoking cessation counseling.

226
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:19,909
Again, exercising at least three
times a week for 30 minutes

227
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:23,183
ideally five times a week for 30 minutes,

228
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:25,586
sometimes it's hard to
get patients to start off

229
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:28,407
exercising five times a
week, 30 minutes a day.

230
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:30,427
So it's okay to stay,
"Let's start two days a week

231
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:33,504
"or three days a week" and
then increase from there.

232
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,883
Also that 30 minutes can
be broken up into 10 minute

233
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:36,882
increments.

234
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:39,529
They did a study with that,
so if you want to exercise

235
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,304
10 minutes before work,
10 minutes at lunch,

236
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:45,845
and then 10 minutes after
work, that's you're 30 minutes.

237
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,784
Technically.

238
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:52,451
So healthy diet, more or
less 1500 kilocals per day.

239
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:55,784
Three meals per day with two
snacks is the healthiest way

240
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:57,943
to eat and again, watching your calories,

241
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,589
watching your carbohydrates.

242
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:04,085
Increase raw foods, fruits
and vegetables are going

243
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,071
to be the healthiest.

244
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:07,544
The same things that we
talked about with the TLC diet

245
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:08,972
and the dash diet.

246
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:11,109
Same principles apply to obesity.

247
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:15,706
And then increase protein
and decrease fats and

248
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:17,535
carbohydrates.

249
00:13:18,446 --> 00:13:20,391
So now read through that real quick.

250
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:47,564
So now he comes back and his BMI's higher.

251
00:13:47,564 --> 00:13:51,906
So now it's 33, which is over
30, like we talked about.

252
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:55,261
His waist circumference is 42.

253
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:57,688
Do you know what the cutoff
is we're looking for men

254
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,847
for waist circumference?

255
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:02,146
40, mm-hmm, so he's over that.

256
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:06,848
Not eating healthy, not exercising,

257
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,681
and now he has hypertension
and dyslipidemia,

258
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:13,125
so we have some comorbidities.

259
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:16,108
What's an appropriate
treatment option at this point?

260
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,568
BELVIQ, okay.

261
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,086
So we could start a pharmacotherapy agent.

262
00:14:24,086 --> 00:14:28,599
Other complications, this should
be pretty straightforward.

263
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:32,325
I mean, we could have
diabetes, heart issues,

264
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:35,100
brain issues, kidney issues, liver issues,

265
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,364
a lot of things come along with obesity.

266
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:41,364
And is bariatric surgery
an option at this point?

267
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,181
No.

268
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:47,057
Only over 40 and that still
has to be heavily considered

269
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:50,321
if they have a lot of
comorbidities, high cardiovascular

270
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:54,024
risk, and then it's a complicated process.

271
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:56,196
They have to decrease the
amount of food they eat

272
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:59,319
ahead of time and afterwards,
so really that's reserved

273
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:00,145
for very
