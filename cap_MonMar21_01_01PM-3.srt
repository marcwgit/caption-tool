1
00:00:02,728 --> 00:00:05,879
- Who says yes, they'd change therapy?

2
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:09,374
Who says no?

3
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:13,420
The other 50 of you
aren't paying attention.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,872
(laughing)

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:17,238
35 year old female.

6
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:18,913
What I wanted to stress with this

7
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:22,026
is can a 35 year old female get pregnant?

8
00:00:23,283 --> 00:00:26,627
Yes, and statins are what?

9
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,073
Category X.

10
00:00:28,073 --> 00:00:30,579
Just something you always
want to think about

11
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:32,242
if you're in a retail pharmacy

12
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:36,239
and you see a female that
could potentially be pregnant,

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,157
you always just want to make sure

14
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:40,057
that they're either using contraception

15
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:41,876
or are at least aware of the fact

16
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,212
that it's pregnancy category X.

17
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:47,241
It's something doctors
forget to say a lot.

18
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:52,236
In that case, let's say
she's trying to get pregnant.

19
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:55,076
What would you recommend?

20
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:06,097
Okay, lifestyle changes is
a perfectly reasonable ...

21
00:01:06,097 --> 00:01:08,553
Fish oil isn't going to hurt.

22
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:11,051
Really that's probably it for now.

23
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,246
Mostly, as long as cholesterol,

24
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,973
triglycerides aren't over 500

25
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:18,553
and cholesterol isn't
in a dangerous level,

26
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:20,939
then you could just do
therapeutic lifestyle changes

27
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,056
until after the pregnancy
and breastfeeding.

28
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:27,727
I'll let you guys read through this one.

29
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:57,053
We have a 38 year old male

30
00:01:57,053 --> 00:01:58,678
who's on simvastatin 20

31
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:01,769
and gemfibrozil 600 twice a day.

32
00:02:01,769 --> 00:02:05,332
LDL is 110, so just slightly elevated.

33
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,122
HDL is 38

34
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:10,083
and triglycerides are 240.

35
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,232
AST/ALT normal.

36
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:17,256
What would you want to do in
this patient at this time?

37
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,420
Barkley's question is if you can take

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,444
simvastatin 20 milligrams and gemfibrozil?

39
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,945
The answer is no and that's
the point of this question.

40
00:02:36,945 --> 00:02:38,281
You can, yes.

41
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:39,698
That's the highest dose you can take,

42
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:42,514
but ideally you would
just want to discontinue

43
00:02:42,514 --> 00:02:45,427
the simvastatin if the
patient's on gemfibrozil,

44
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:47,969
pick a more lipophilic statin.

45
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:50,266
Pravastatin is always a good option.

46
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:52,993
Less interactions with 3A4.

47
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:56,089
Of course you want to tell
him to avoid grapefruit juice.

48
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:58,833
Pravastatin, atorvastatin
is also another fine choice.

49
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,539
It has less interactions,

50
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,378
and if that patient needed that

51
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:04,588
because pravastatin you
can only increase so high

52
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,640
and only moderate intensity.

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,506
If the patient is eventually
going to need a high intensity,

54
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:12,087
atorvastatin would be a good choice.

55
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:14,136
The main point here is that you want to

56
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:16,055
note that interaction.

57
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:18,528
Also another good option would just be

58
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:21,413
to switch to fenofibrate, Tricor.

59
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,925
It has some interaction but not as much.

60
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:26,838
Knowing that interaction
is very important.

61
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:34,885
Hydrophilic, sorry.

62
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:36,763
Pravastatin's going to be your best option

63
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,054
but then you have to think about

64
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:40,467
as high as you can titrate it.

65
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:41,945
Thank you.

66
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:58,128
Now we have a 64 year old
female who comes to clinic.

67
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:00,662
Hypertension, diabetes, and GERD.

68
00:04:00,662 --> 00:04:03,791
On Lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide.

69
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,075
LDL is 178, so pretty high.

70
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:09,243
Triglycerides, 200

71
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:12,194
and HDL slightly low at 39.

72
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:15,641
Her 10 year ASCVD is 7.2.

73
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:19,287
What would you recommend for this patient?

74
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:39,554
She's less than 7.5% right now,

75
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:42,169
something you would definitely
want to continue monitoring.

76
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:44,099
Moderate intensity was fine.

77
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:45,735
I think you could also argue

78
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,794
that you would initiate a high intensity,

79
00:04:47,794 --> 00:04:50,257
that she's close and a little bit older

80
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:52,601
and has comorbidities.

81
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,078
Clinically you could argue

82
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:55,879
but the black and white per the guidelines

83
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,342
would be that she's less than 7.5.

84
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:02,152
Then you always want to
reevaluate their lipid panel.

85
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:04,776
Guidelines say four to 12 weeks.

86
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:07,404
I usually go with right
around six to eight weeks,

87
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:09,821
but if your patient also has diabetes,

88
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,035
it's going to make sense
to go ahead and get the A1C

89
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:13,875
and the lipid panel at the same time,

90
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,757
which might be in that 12 week time frame.

91
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:21,590
Again, you don't need to
get the LFTs or CPK again

92
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,062
unless clinically indicated.

93
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:29,643
Now this patient comes
back and has muscle pain

94
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,995
and is feeling fatigued.

95
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,245
What would you recommend?

96
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,653
I heard a few different things
and they're all correct.

97
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,171
There's a few options.

98
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:54,681
You can stop what medication they're on,

99
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:57,691
see if the symptoms go
away, and rechallenge.

100
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,111
Alternatively you could lower the dose

101
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,212
and see if symptoms go away.

102
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:04,831
I have a lot of patients
that are on atorvastatin 80

103
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,023
who will have muscle cramps,

104
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:09,399
atorvastatin 40 they go away.

105
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,960
Yes, sir?

106
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,989
Two to four weeks.

107
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:18,534
Wait until the symptoms
resolve, if they resolve.

108
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:21,214
If they don't resolve, it's
something else going on.

109
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,849
I'd give it two to four weeks

110
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,405
and then you could rechallenge.

111
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,558
Hopefully it's not a disease state

112
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:30,466
where you're worried about
immediate harm to the patient

113
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,952
so you have that wiggle room.

114
00:06:32,952 --> 00:06:34,913
That's a good question.

115
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,418
You could stop it, decrease the dose,

116
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,675
or you can switch to another statin.

117
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:45,998
Simvastatin is notorious for
having more muscle cramps

118
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:50,619
and muscle pains than let's
say atorvastatin or Crestor.

119
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,454
You can always try and
switch to another statin.

120
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,887
There's three good options.

121
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:56,622
All of them are correct.

122
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:00,382
I think that's happening in
your guys' case this week

123
00:07:00,382 --> 00:07:03,193
if I understood correctly.

124
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:12,862
Now this patient's having muscle pains

125
00:07:12,862 --> 00:07:16,202
and tells you they're
having dark colored urine.

126
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,289
What would you recommend
for this patient to do?

127
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:25,828
Guesses?

128
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:31,204
This would be rhabdomyolysis, right?

129
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:33,001
That's what we're worried about.

130
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:36,522
Dark colored urine,
almost Coca-Cola looking.

131
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,825
What is that from?

132
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,814
It's actually the muscle breakdown,

133
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,750
so it's the protein in the urine

134
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,479
and they need to go
straight to the hospital

135
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,120
is the answer to that.

136
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,210
It's nothing you can do outpatient.

137
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,209
They need to stop the statin first of all

138
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,055
and then go to the hospital.

139
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:02,302
All they do to treat
rhabdo is fluids mostly

140
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:06,310
and then monitoring of
course for clearing up.

141
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,951
That's not something that
can be treated outpatient

142
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,329
by just drinking water
and stopping the statin.

143
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,395
It's very serious.

144
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:14,455
You want to make sure you know to

145
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:16,833
recommend to go to the hospital.

146
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:19,142
Okay.

147
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:23,591
Next we have a 53 year old female

148
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:26,969
who was started on Niaspan

149
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:31,245
and she wants to know a little
bit more about this medicine.

150
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,815
What could you tell her
about this medicine?

151
00:08:40,112 --> 00:08:41,584
Anybody?

152
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,293
Okay, extended release would be good.

153
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,168
Why is that ...

154
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:54,390
Okay, so less to the liver, and what else?

155
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,138
Flushing, yeah.

156
00:08:57,138 --> 00:09:00,170
That's a big counseling
point with this one.

157
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,235
Flushing, itching, red face,

158
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:06,245
and then you want to
worry about the liver too.

159
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:10,790
It can also cause hyperglycemia
and hyperuricemia.

160
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,946
You want to take it with
food and avoid spicy foods

161
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:15,988
and hot beverages.

162
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:20,287
Flushing might diminish,

163
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:24,124
and then you can actually
pre-treat about 30 minutes before

164
00:09:24,124 --> 00:09:27,085
with Aspirin or ibuprofen

165
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:29,190
30 to 60 minutes before,

166
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,153
and that should reduce
some of the flushing.

167
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:36,548
Now, what do the guidelines
say about niacin use

168
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:38,727
or Niaspan use?

169
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:45,016
Okay, so Barkley said
the AIM-HIGH trial said

170
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,276
it doesn't show benefits,
which is correct.

171
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:50,803
The guidelines actually don't
necessarily recommend it,

172
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:53,468
but you will still see patients on it.

173
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,387
There are still studies that show

174
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,181
that there is some benefit.

175
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:01,383
It increases HDL and decreases
triglycerides a little bit.

176
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,976
Mostly benefit is increasing the HDL.

177
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:07,530
Some physicians will add
it on after statin therapy,

178
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,332
they'll go ahead and add this on.

179
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,332
It's important just to
know how to counsel on it,

180
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:14,163
main side effects and then
worrying about the liver

181
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,266
and the flushing are going
to be the two main things

182
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:19,027
you want to take home about this one.

183
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:40,428
Now we have a 52 year old female

184
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:44,194
who has a history of hypertriglyceridemia.

185
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:48,168
She's on Lopid 600 twice a day.

186
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:52,375
Triglycerides are still
high, even on the max dose.

187
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,169
She wants to take something more natural.

188
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:58,984
What could you recommend that
would help with triglycerides?

189
00:10:58,984 --> 00:11:01,196
Fish oil, yes.

190
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:04,500
You have to look at the ...

191
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:07,861
I can't think of the things right now.

192
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:10,176
DPA FHA content.

193
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:12,549
Lovaza, it's already built in for you.

194
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:14,564
They're going to take one gram.

195
00:11:14,564 --> 00:11:16,055
The over the counter ones,

196
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:19,840
they might be taking as many
as two pills twice a day,

197
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,784
depending on the content.

198
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:26,337
It's important over the counter
products, you look at that.

199
00:11:28,285 --> 00:11:29,965
Any omega-3 fatty acids.

200
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,762
The best are going to
be the prescribed ones

201
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:34,895
because it already has the
correct amount in there.

202
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:39,243
Now we have a 55 year old female

203
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:42,191
with five year history of hypertension.

204
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:46,171
She smokes and doesn't
drink or use illicit drugs.

205
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:48,430
Total cholesterol is 180.

206
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,275
LDL is 131.

207
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,038
HDL is 35.

208
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:54,519
Triglycerides, 195.

209
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,101
What would you recommend?

210
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,611
Any guesses?

211
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:17,291
Moderate intensity, yes.

212
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,082
You would want to calculate,

213
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:22,276
well I guess that was (mumbling)

214
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:26,058
You'd want to calculate the ASCVD risk.

215
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:29,320
Being 55, I maybe should
have made this person

216
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,261
a little bit younger
with no smoking history.

217
00:12:35,703 --> 00:12:38,736
If the ASCVD risk was below the 7.5

218
00:12:38,736 --> 00:12:41,539
and the only other
comorbidity was hypertension,

219
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:46,093
you might want to try
lifestyle recommendations first

220
00:12:46,093 --> 00:12:48,582
and then go on.

221
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:51,816
If we're going to tell a
hypercholesterolemia patient

222
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:53,864
to do lifestyle modifications,

223
00:12:53,864 --> 00:12:57,257
what modifications are we talking about?

224
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:59,425
The same exercise,

225
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:02,081
but it's a little bit
different than the DASH diet

226
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,626
when we're talking about cholesterol.

227
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,868
Low fat?

228
00:13:09,868 --> 00:13:11,162
Okay, very good.

229
00:13:11,162 --> 00:13:12,985
Yeah, that's going to be the main focus.

230
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:16,718
You want to go over what
foods have fats in them.

231
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:19,725
A lot of people don't
think about the cheese

232
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:22,386
and the fried foods.

233
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:25,057
Maybe some of the healthier fats even,

234
00:13:25,057 --> 00:13:27,263
like in cheese, they don't realize.

235
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:29,333
You want to make sure that
you talk about those with them

236
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,637
and then the same thing,

237
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:34,127
exercise, lowering alcohol content.

238
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:36,819
Alcohol's tricky because
it can actually increase

239
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:38,088
HDL slightly,

240
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:39,963
but that's still not
something we want to recommend

241
00:13:39,963 --> 00:13:42,287
to our patient.

242
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:46,011
Just in general, same
lifestyle modifications.

243
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:50,526
I'll let you read through this.

244
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:20,420
Now we have a 48 year old male.

245
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,035
Dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, DVT.

246
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:27,289
Doctor wants to initiate Welchol,

247
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,685
which is a bile acid sequestrant.

248
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:36,236
LDL is high, 160 so it might
be time to add something else

249
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:39,202
if we can't titrate the atorvastatin.

250
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:41,534
Triglycerides, 320.

251
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:43,242
HDL, 42.

252
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:46,126
Total cholesterol, 199.

253
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:50,228
Would you guys initiate
Welchol at this time?

254
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:52,816
Let's say we can't
titrate the atorvastatin.

255
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,534
Yes?
