1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,759
- That's the first thing you wanna do

2
00:00:01,759 --> 00:00:04,219
before you add a third agent in this case.

3
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:06,352
Because he's already on lisinopril 40.

4
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:08,302
So from 40 to 80 you're not gonna see

5
00:00:08,302 --> 00:00:11,715
too much of a clinical change.

6
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:15,108
So 40's kinda max therapeutic dose.

7
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:17,384
Amlodipine we can go all the way up to 10,

8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,456
and he was only on 2.5,

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,163
and his blood pressure wasn't that high

10
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:24,170
that we were worried about
any hypertensive urgency

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,491
or emergency.

12
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:27,888
So that's a perfectly fine answer.

13
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:30,253
And then if he comes back
and it's still elevated,

14
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:31,915
I would titrate again.

15
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,750
So once he was on amlodapine 10

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,568
and lisinopril 40, and
it was still elevated,

17
00:00:39,568 --> 00:00:40,885
what would you guys do?

18
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,428
So we'll go back to him.

19
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,707
I think I heard thiazide diuretic.

20
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:54,707
Yeah, okay, and that's right.

21
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,516
So you always wanna go back and think

22
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:59,584
what the guidelines say are
gonna be our first line agent.

23
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:01,454
And he's already on an ACE,

24
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:02,977
so it's ACE or ARB,

25
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:06,501
you don't want somebody
on an ACE and an ARB.

26
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:07,812
So he's already on that ACE,

27
00:01:07,812 --> 00:01:09,539
already on the calcium channel blocker,

28
00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:12,160
then you would just do a
thiazide-like diuretic.

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,483
And you can HCTZ, or chlorthalidone.

30
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:17,551
They're both proven. Yes, sir.

31
00:01:25,997 --> 00:01:27,984
Yeah, I don't know why that's on there.

32
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:35,921
I don't know why the
calcium level's on there.

33
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,161
Don't worry about that for this case,

34
00:01:37,161 --> 00:01:39,199
but yeah, you would wanna look at that.

35
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:45,734
Okay, so now this same patient

36
00:01:45,734 --> 00:01:48,214
is having swelling in his legs,

37
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:49,554
and you examine him,

38
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:52,862
and he is having +1
pitting peripheral edema.

39
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,809
So why do you think that would be?

40
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:06,977
Okay, so Barclay thinks it's from

41
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:09,273
the calcium channel blocker, and I agree.

42
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,883
And you may see that

43
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:14,117
when you initiate a
calcium channel blocker,

44
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:18,942
or when you increase dose with
a calcium channel blocker.

45
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:23,311
What main side effects are we
worried about besides cough

46
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,388
with ACE inhibitors?

47
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:27,830
Edema, yep.

48
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,284
So, same thing, just in the lips usually.

49
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,240
Lips, tongue, face.

50
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:38,232
What about a main side effect

51
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:41,393
with our thiazide-like diuretics?

52
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:42,698
We kinda talked about that.

53
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,983
Hypercalcemia, and then the hypokalemia.

54
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,475
So really, electrolytes we wanna monitor.

55
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:52,160
And then what other side effects

56
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,277
do we wanna counsel on

57
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:55,012
with the thiazide-like diuretics?

58
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:58,717
Urination, okay.

59
00:02:58,717 --> 00:02:59,894
So yeah, you always wanna tell them

60
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:01,033
to take it in the morning,

61
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:04,370
you may have increased urinary frequency.

62
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:31,672
So now we have a 50-year-old male

63
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:33,500
who has hypertension.

64
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,284
He has a past medical history of MI.

65
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:38,416
So what medication would somebody

66
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,408
that has had a past medical history of MI

67
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:41,612
need to be on?

68
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,125
A beta blocker.

69
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,235
So I think sometimes people
get confused with that too.

70
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:50,364
No, beta blockers are not
first line for hypertension

71
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,293
per JNC 8 guidelines.

72
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:55,503
But if you have a patient
that's had heart failure

73
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,088
or previous MI,

74
00:03:57,088 --> 00:04:00,054
you're going to want them
to be on a beta blocker.

75
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:02,392
And that beta blocker
will serve two purposes.

76
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:06,556
It will help them with
their other problem,

77
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:08,609
and it will lower their blood pressure.

78
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:09,645
So that's a good thing.

79
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,839
So that's the one time that
the rule doesn't apply,

80
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:14,090
that it's not first line for hypertension.

81
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:19,773
Now the physician has decided,

82
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:21,926
okay they're on a beta blocker,

83
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:24,162
and they're on an ACE inhibitor,

84
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:26,008
I wanna add a diuretic.

85
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:29,692
And we know the sodium's
141, so that's fine,

86
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:32,048
potassium's 3.7, fine.

87
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:35,863
Creatinine clearance is
just a little bit low, 47.4.

88
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,963
So what diuretic would you think to add?

89
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:46,443
Chlorthalidone, okay.
That's a fine choice.

90
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:48,926
So if you look at the diuretics,

91
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:51,858
you don't wanna use HCTZ
when they get below 30,

92
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,398
but our patient's above 30 right now.

93
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:57,832
What other diuretics
are options in general

94
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:00,522
in hypertension, or for
treatment of other things?

95
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:02,013
What diuretics do we have?

96
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,571
Okay, so we have loop
diuretics, so furosemide.

97
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:11,092
I just wanna make it clear that usually

98
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:14,516
you're not going to use
furosemide to treat hypertension,

99
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:17,577
as the treatment of hypertension.

100
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:21,540
So they'll be put on it
for peripheral edema,

101
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,600
potentially from heart failure,

102
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,243
and then they might be on it PRN.

103
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:28,557
It will help with
lowering of blood pressure

104
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:30,588
if they're on it for something else,

105
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:32,152
but you wanna make sure
that you understand

106
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:34,408
that you don't put them on
it as a first line agent

107
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:35,826
for hypertension.

108
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,448
What else? What other diuretics?

109
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,249
Okay, potassium-sparing,

110
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:47,605
so we have spironolactone and eplerenone.

111
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:50,191
When would you use
those with hypertension?

112
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,117
Okay, so if they've had heart failure

113
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:58,068
it's a good option.

114
00:05:58,068 --> 00:06:00,414
Also if they're resistant hypertension.

115
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:02,060
So if they're kind of on everything

116
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,092
that's first line already,

117
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:07,423
sometimes they're gonna have elevated ADH,

118
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:10,959
so aldosterone, and that's
a good option for them.

119
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,890
What are we worried about with

120
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,029
those potassium-sparing diuretics?

121
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,008
Okay, so potassium too
high, that's a good point.

122
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:23,780
So you always wanna make sure

123
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,014
you check their potassium
before you start them,

124
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:27,884
and then about a month
after you start them.

125
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:30,972
Same thing with ACEs and ARBs,
but this is even more so.

126
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,031
And what about main side effects?

127
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,551
Gynecomastia, yep.

128
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,120
Eplerenone has less gynecomastia

129
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,726
than spirinolactone.

130
00:06:42,726 --> 00:06:45,469
So if your patient's
insurance is gonna cover it,

131
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:47,980
usually that's a little
bit better of an option.

132
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,375
Again, not first line in hypertension,

133
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,687
but if it's treatment
resistant, you can use it.

134
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:57,862
There's also triamterene you might see,

135
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,304
not first line,

136
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:01,904
but especially some of the
more old school doctors

137
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:04,964
will put them on triamterene, HCTZ.

138
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:06,995
And then I put this question in,

139
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:09,774
is MJ adequately beta blocked?

140
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,852
So let's take a look at the pulse here,

141
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:15,240
what do you guys think?

142
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:21,011
How do you tell if somebody's
adequately beta blocked?

143
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:28,441
Okay, I'm hearing 60-80 normal limits.

144
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:29,746
Any other guesses?

145
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:37,827
Usually about 60 to 70

146
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:39,411
is gonna mean that they're kind of

147
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,362
maximally adequately beta blocked.

148
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:44,187
60 to 80, I would agree with as well

149
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:47,072
if it's kind of on the
lower end of normal,

150
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,703
all the way down to 60.

151
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,359
Anything below 60

152
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,981
you're gonna kinda start
to worry a little bit,

153
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:55,322
but that's how you tell.

154
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:57,734
So if a patient, even if they're on

155
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:02,280
maximum dose atenolol,
maximum dose metoprolol,

156
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,596
if their pulse is still over 90

157
00:08:04,596 --> 00:08:05,673
that means that beta blocker

158
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:08,172
is not adequately
working for that patient.

159
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,504
So you always wanna take
a look at that as well.

160
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:14,094
Okay, these I just put for your benefit,

161
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,714
I'm not reading through these.

162
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:20,096
Basically goal is gonna
be less than 140/90

163
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:20,950
as we've stated,

164
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,408
for the most part, for most diseases.

165
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,988
And then you have to go to
the individual guidelines

166
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:28,286
for each disease state.

167
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,559
So CKD guidelines for CKD,

168
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:33,465
which is actually now in
conjunction with the 140/90.

169
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:34,602
But it used to be different.

170
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:36,329
Diabetes used to be different,

171
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:37,955
now they're all kinda
getting on board together,

172
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:39,027
so that's good.

173
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:42,129
Then I just put in some basic slides,

174
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,551
I'm not redoing your IT slides,

175
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:45,848
you guys have already
had hypertension and IT.

176
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:49,647
But main medications used,

177
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:52,105
main side effects,

178
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:54,239
so our ACEs and our ARBs,

179
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:57,225
of course we wanna look out for cough,

180
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:59,236
and then elevated potassium.

181
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:01,400
And the edema like we talked about.

182
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,924
Calcium channel blockers,

183
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:05,058
when would you use a non-dihydropyridine

184
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,369
calcium channel blocker for hypertension?

185
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:13,545
Or would you use the non-dihydropyridine?

186
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,248
Not too sure?

187
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:20,799
Maybe some people are
sure, but I can't hear you.

188
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:24,692
The main difference is gonna be

189
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,075
that these act centrally, right,

190
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,476
they're gonna act on the heart.

191
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:29,366
So if it's an afib patient

192
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:31,255
that's trying to be rate-controlled,

193
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:32,861
hopefully you guys know,

194
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:34,725
I think you guys had
an afib case last week,

195
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:37,989
that these are gonna be your
calcium channel blockers

196
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:39,310
that you're going to.

197
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,500
If your patient also has hypertension,

198
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,811
that's when you would use that medication.

199
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:47,284
And then your dihyrdopyridines

200
00:09:47,284 --> 00:09:48,645
are gonna act more peripherally

201
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:52,110
to vasodilate, and then reduce
your blood pressure that way.

202
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,264
So these are gonna be
when we're talking about

203
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:57,393
first line hypertension medicines,

204
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:59,384
and we say calcium channel blockers,

205
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:01,802
these are the medicines
that we're talking about.

206
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,975
Not so much these unless there's another

207
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:05,661
comorphic condition that indicates

208
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:08,248
that you would use
verapamil and diltiazem.

209
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:16,058
Beta blockers, again,

210
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,100
you wanna make sure

211
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,381
that your patient has another indication.

212
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:22,292
It wouldn't be your first choice to start

213
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:25,175
unless they're having
repeatedly high pulse

214
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:26,273
for unknown reason.

215
00:10:26,273 --> 00:10:27,899
And in that case you
would definitely wanna

216
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,382
go ahead an get an EKG

217
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:32,078
to make sure something
else isn't going on.

218
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,430
But previous MI, or CHF,

219
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,198
that's when you would use these,

220
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:39,225
and you want to make
sure that you start low

221
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:40,261
and go slow.

222
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:41,683
That's how I learned beta blockers.

223
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,466
So start at a low dose and then titrate.

224
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:47,109
And same thing when you
discontinue beta blockers.

225
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:49,835
So you don't just wanna
stop a beta blocker,

226
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:51,111
you wanna decrease the dose

227
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:54,625
and titrate back down until
you stop the beta blocker.

228
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,738
Then once you have titrated down,

229
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:58,365
then you can start your new agent

230
00:10:58,365 --> 00:10:59,725
if the purpose of titrating

231
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,459
is that you're switching agents.

232
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:04,682
You also wanna make sure,

233
00:11:04,682 --> 00:11:06,531
because a lot of our hypertension patients

234
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:08,339
may also have diabetes,

235
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,945
so if they are on a beta blocker

236
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,529
it's important to tell them that

237
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:13,400
it might mask the signs and symptoms

238
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,166
of hypoglycemia.

239
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,093
All of them besides, what?

240
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,623
What won't a beta blocker mask?

241
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,168
Sweating.

242
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:31,055
So it'll mask the palpitations,
dizziness feeling,

243
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:33,209
but they'll still have the sweating

244
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,780
if they have the sweating.

245
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:37,547
Okay, that kind of does that.

246
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,777
So any major questions on hypertension?

247
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:43,464
I tried to kinda cover
through different cases.

248
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,817
Nope, okay.

249
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:50,113
Well, hopefully that helps to distinguish

250
00:11:50,113 --> 00:11:51,664
a little bit in your head.

251
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,447
So now let's go on to dyslipidemia.

252
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,575
Let you guys read through that.

253
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:23,165
So we have a 45-year-old

254
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:28,146
Caucasian male who has type 2 diabetes.

255
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:32,149
And blood pressure's 135/86,

256
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,855
so just a little bit elevated.

257
00:12:33,855 --> 00:12:35,968
Total cholesterol is 210.

258
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:37,173
What's our goal here?

259
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:39,676
200.

260
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,110
HDL is 37. What's our goal for men?

261
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,107
Over 40. And women?

262
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:45,859
50.

263
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,380
LDL is 170. What's our goal here?

264
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:53,706
100, so he's a diabetic patient.

265
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,717
And then it's controversial,

266
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:58,176
but the guidelines actually say

267
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:00,451
cardiovascular issues as well,

268
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:02,529
you can push to less than 70.

269
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:06,654
Triglycerides are 320,
what's our goal here?

270
00:13:08,213 --> 00:13:09,513
Less than 150.

271
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:12,530
At what point do we worry
about triglycerides?

272
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,719
500, good.

273
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:15,218
Man, you guys are good today.

274
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,119
And A1C's just a little bit high at 7.2.

275
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,750
Overweight, 210 at 5'6.

276
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,680
Smokes two packs a day,

277
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,215
and somebody calculated their
ASCVD 10 year risk score

278
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:30,609
at 8.5%.

279
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:34,672
So what medicine would you want to start?

280
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,917
High-intensity statin, okay.

281
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,732
And which statins are those?

282
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:42,793
Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, yep.

283
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:44,216
Lipitor and Crestor, okay.

284
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:47,568
And certain doses, so Crestor either dose,

285
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:50,250
but then atorvastatin is
gonna be the 40 to 80.

286
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,206
20 is actually a moderate intensity.

287
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:56,687
There we go.

288
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:00,399
So you wanna look at the age, 40 to 75,

289
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,959
diabetes, ASCVD risk,

290
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,706
and then you'll start a statin.

291
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:06,372
What labs do you wanna get

292
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:07,983
when you start a statin?

293
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:12,026
I heard CPK. What else?

294
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:17,079
I heard ALT. Let's go with both.

295
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,456
Liver function test, so AST, ALT.

296
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,874
And then you would ideally have

297
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:23,470
a lipid panel as well.

298
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,883
But CPK, and then your LFTs.

299
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:29,819
Now, you only monitor your CPK, LFTs

300
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,586
when clinically indicated.

301
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:35,406
So if your patient is having
signs or symptoms, or issues.

302
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:36,889
It's not something you're gonna get

303
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,755
every time you get a lipid panel.

304
00:14:41,857 --> 00:14:44,823
So now this patient's
a 35-year-old female.

305
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:48,538
Would your choice of therapy be different,

306
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:50,495
and if yes, what would it be?
