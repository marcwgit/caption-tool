1
00:00:06,767 --> 00:00:09,355
- (laughs) He's a little shrimp.

2
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:11,324
I'm betting that would be 140.

3
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:15,563
Nothing.

4
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:16,778
Not a thing.

5
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:06,494
Okay, so does anybody wanna take a guess

6
00:01:06,494 --> 00:01:07,963
what they would start?

7
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:11,120
ACE inhibitor, okay.

8
00:01:14,016 --> 00:01:14,751
That's right.

9
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:18,820
Let's go back to the patient.

10
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,723
42 year old white male.

11
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:22,866
So you always wanna look at the age first.

12
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:28,456
Patients that are younger than 75

13
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,116
are gonna be

14
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:34,149
less than 140 over 90 is their goal.

15
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:36,483
So you wanna make sure
you know their goal.

16
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:38,763
If they're older and
they have a co-morbidity,

17
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:41,677
same goal, less than 140 over 90.

18
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:44,164
So that's always for the
most part gonna be your goal.

19
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,627
Next thing you wanna look
at is their ethnicity

20
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:51,414
because JNCA have
different recommendations

21
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:55,767
for African Americans versus Caucasians.

22
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:59,378
Now, African Americans, first line.

23
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:00,957
If they have no other disease states,

24
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,453
this is where some people
get a little bit confused

25
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:05,833
is gonna be a calcium channel blocker

26
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,772
and we're talking about
the dihydropyridine,

27
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:10,292
or a thiazide-like diuretic.

28
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,788
ACEs and ARBs are second line.

29
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:17,176
But if they are diabetic or
have chronic kidney disease

30
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:20,577
then ACEs or ARBs would
be recommended first line.

31
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:21,848
Does everybody understand that point

32
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:24,222
'cause I think people get
confused sometimes with that.

33
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:30,288
So the next thing you wanna look at,

34
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:33,945
well, you wanna hope your
patient's not 14 pounds.

35
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,768
Look at past medical history.

36
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:39,237
So we do have some other
co-morbidities going on.

37
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:41,712
Dyslipidemia and Type II diabetes.

38
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:44,138
So Type II diabetes, I
agree with whoever said

39
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:46,473
ACE or ARB, that would
be my first thought.

40
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:48,707
You wanna make sure your
patients are on that.

41
00:02:49,596 --> 00:02:53,172
And dyslipidemia doesn't
have a direct response

42
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,250
to what agent you would choose,

43
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,817
but it's just good to know that they have

44
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,901
increased cardiovascular risk.

45
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:04,015
So vitals, 163 over 95,
definitely elevated,

46
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:07,358
to their goal of less than 140 over 90.

47
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:10,348
And then heart rate's always
important to look at too.

48
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,440
If you have a patient
with a heart rate over 100

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,193
you might wanna think maybe
they need a beta blocker

50
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:20,037
if they're consistently having
a really elevated pulse.

51
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:21,762
Maybe they need some rate control.

52
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,215
Labs, these are just some labs.

53
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:28,727
You do always wanna take
into consideration potassium.

54
00:03:29,858 --> 00:03:31,937
Somebody said ACE inhibitor.

55
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:33,737
Do we know what the goal potassium is?

56
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:35,403
Most hospitals?

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,498
3.5 to 5.

58
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,019
So this one's just slightly elevated,

59
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,517
kind of on the border,

60
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:42,119
not something we would clinically

61
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,940
be worried about the patient having

62
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,310
any real issues.

63
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,516
But you may not want to initiate

64
00:03:48,516 --> 00:03:51,094
an ACE or an ARB in this patient because

65
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:53,253
their potassium's already elevated.

66
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:55,802
ACEs and ARBs can increase potassium.

67
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,578
You always want to assess smoking,

68
00:04:00,578 --> 00:04:02,959
drinking, illicit drugs, diet.

69
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,310
And we'll get some of
our cases will have that.

70
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:08,137
So what's the appropriate therapy?

71
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:11,178
Well first line in the
JNCA you're going to

72
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,455
automatically have for Caucasian patient

73
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,380
ACE, ARB, calcium channel blocker,

74
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,377
or thiazide-like diuretic.

75
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:21,263
So that's mostly
hydrochlorothiazide chlorthalidone.

76
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:26,295
You kind of maybe would
rule out the ACE or the ARB

77
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:28,066
because of their potassium.

78
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,519
And then you have the
calcium channel blocker

79
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,241
or the HCTZ, either of which
would be a good option.

80
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:42,851
Usually we start the ACTZ at 12.5

81
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,277
and then we'll titrate from there.

82
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:48,179
You wanna make sure that
you counsel dizziness,

83
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:52,058
always hypotension with
the thiazide-like diuretics

84
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,857
as a possibility.

85
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:55,598
Smaller possibility than beta blockers

86
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:57,491
but still a possibility.

87
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:59,314
You're gonna wanna monitor labs

88
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:03,110
particularly potassium, maybe sodium.

89
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,036
I have seen cases where the
sodium actually goes low.

90
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:09,003
We remove the HCTZ and it bumped back up.

91
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,506
Counseling points, counsel
on general hypotension.

92
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,576
NSAIDs may interfere.

93
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:20,212
And then reevaluate in two to four weeks,

94
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:23,950
that's just gonna be
dependent on clinical use,

95
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,817
so you could say two weeks
would be a fine recommendation,

96
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:29,320
four weeks would be a fine
recommendation as well.

97
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:33,134
Does anybody have any
questions on that case

98
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:35,508
and kind of the thought process behind it?

99
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:44,279
So now let's say this patient
is an African American male.

100
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,410
Would your recommendations change?

101
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,369
So Berkeley said

102
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:00,371
take off the ACE and ARB which is correct,

103
00:06:00,371 --> 00:06:02,356
which we weren't gonna
do anyways just because

104
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:03,656
of the potassium.

105
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,036
But that's the main difference between

106
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:08,219
Caucasian and African American.

107
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,530
And I wanna stress like I said before

108
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,839
if a patient is African American

109
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,893
and has diabetes or chronic kidney disease

110
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:19,399
they'll still use an ACE
or an ARB as first line

111
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,868
for renal protection.

112
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,179
Okay, next case.

113
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,097
I'll let you guys read through that

114
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:28,763
and give you a couple of minutes.

115
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,230
So does anybody wanna take

116
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,618
a stab at this one?

117
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:25,133
You guys should know
this from case studies

118
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,533
like the back of your hand.

119
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,986
Just nobody wants to talk,
you're in class all morning?

120
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:38,167
DASH diet, okay.

121
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:56,840
Berkeley basically said DASH diet,

122
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,582
so look at total fats.

123
00:07:58,582 --> 00:08:02,466
Generally increase fruits
and vegetables, low fat.

124
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:07,343
Sodium less than 2.3
grams per day ideally.

125
00:08:08,323 --> 00:08:10,122
If they're in that higher risk population

126
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:14,250
they've actually recommended
less than 1.5 grams daily.

127
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:19,678
Physical activity try for
about 30 minutes per day,

128
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:23,132
five days per week which will
get you that 150 minutes.

129
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:27,236
Alcohol intake, women, limit to one drink,

130
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:29,772
men limit to two drinks, that's per day.

131
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:33,040
And then smoking, you
always wanna assess that

132
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,276
each visit if they're willing to stop.

133
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,677
Okay, so next case I'll give
you a minute to read through.

134
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:02,688
What's the answer to this one?

135
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:06,745
Lisinopri, yeah.

136
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:07,988
So, Berkeley already said

137
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:10,066
you'd change it to an ARB which is exactly

138
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:12,132
what happens clinically.

139
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:14,094
They come in and you wanna make sure

140
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:17,589
that you quantify or not quantify,

141
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:20,596
determine what type of
cough they're having.

142
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:23,591
So, it's really gonna
be a hacking dry cough

143
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,913
and a pretty consistent cough.

144
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:29,071
If they're coming in and
they're having deep chest

145
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:31,973
coughing up mucus,
that's a different thing.

146
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,634
So you always wanna make
sure that you ask them

147
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:35,359
to describe their cough.

148
00:09:36,954 --> 00:09:41,053
Again, patient is 71 year
old African American male,

149
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:43,468
so we're looking at there hypertension.

150
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:47,531
It looks to be relatively
controlled on the ACE,

151
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:50,440
so just a switch to an ARB we'd be fine.

152
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:54,207
Losartan for example you would just start

153
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:57,527
at 50 milligrams and then
you'd wanna bring them back in

154
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:59,535
and reassess if their blood pressure's

155
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:01,266
controlled at that dose.

156
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:03,420
You might need to go ahead and bump it up.

157
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:09,625
That was just an example.

158
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,809
Any questions on that one?

159
00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:12,778
If you guys have questions
at all just stop me.

160
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,144
Okay, so this next one.

161
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,908
And what would you guys
wanna do with this one?

162
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:54,546
George is smiling.

163
00:10:57,848 --> 00:10:59,677
This one's pretty high, right?

164
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:02,783
2010 over 121.

165
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,487
She's already taken her
blood pressure medicine

166
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:06,889
so I wanted to emphasize that point.

167
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:08,063
You always wanna ask have you taken

168
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:09,892
your blood pressure medicine today.

169
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,101
The answer would still be the
same with what you would do

170
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,529
but then you would also advice the patient

171
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,004
to go ahead and take their blood pressure

172
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:18,024
medicines for the day as long as it wasn't

173
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,679
too close to their next dose.

174
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,923
And then you recheck it.

175
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:24,108
You always wanna do a recheck,

176
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:26,261
make sure the cuff was
sized appropriately.

177
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,345
If there was a manual machine

178
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:30,064
make sure the manual machine's accurate.

179
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,571
You don't wanna just be
giving somebody medicine

180
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:35,108
if it was an error on the machine's part.

181
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,547
It's still really high.

182
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:43,386
So, she's actually over 180 over 120.

183
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,291
So you wanna think about
hypertensive urgency

184
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,474
or hypertensive emergency.

185
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:52,413
Urgency is not associated with target

186
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:56,803
organ injury.

187
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:59,821
And then hypertensive
emergency you are worried about

188
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:01,900
patients having symptoms.

189
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,920
You're worried about organ injury.

190
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,480
What organs are we mostly
talking about here?

191
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,607
Any heart, brain, right?

192
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,047
So a stroke.

193
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,928
And then you'll have your
peripheral stuff too,

194
00:12:13,928 --> 00:12:15,367
so issues with eyes

195
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,763
and peripheral vascular issues.

196
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:23,390
Mostly if you're in an outpatient setting

197
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,733
or if you send them to the emergency room,

198
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,289
so if you're in a retail-type setting

199
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,390
you're not gonna be able
to just give them Clonadine

200
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,563
you're gonna have to call.

201
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:33,908
But what they'll do is
give them Clonadine.

202
00:12:33,908 --> 00:12:38,123
Guideline say 0.2 milligrams
as soon as possible

203
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:40,503
and then you wanna recheck
their blood pressure,

204
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:42,488
and then you can give 0.1 milligrams

205
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:44,346
each hour after that.

206
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,668
In clinic we'll actually
put them in a dark room,

207
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:48,874
have them lie down,

208
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:50,731
take the cellphone away type situation,

209
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:52,878
let them calm down if it's

210
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:55,427
something that's elevated due to stress.

211
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,009
Alternatively you can use Labetalol,

212
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,795
and the goal is to reduce
mean arterial pressure

213
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,618
within 24 hours.

214
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:06,730
Also sometimes it's more old school

215
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,516
but you can use Hydralazine
for the same purpose.

216
00:13:09,516 --> 00:13:11,792
Clonadiine is gonna be your most commonly

217
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,410
used medicine and the one
you should know about.

218
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,016
You do have to worry about,

219
00:13:17,016 --> 00:13:19,431
this isn't a medicine that
we use for hypertension

220
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,672
usually around the clock because

221
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:24,720
it does have really bad
side effects of hypotension

222
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,448
and dizziness, so it's not
good in elderly patients.

223
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:30,968
So try to avoid it just
for hypertension use,

224
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:33,252
but in this situation it's okay.

225
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:34,976
Does anyone have any questions on that?

226
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:41,935
Okay, we kind of already
talked about this one.

227
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,910
I got a little ahead of myself.

228
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,961
Yeah?

229
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:48,606
Captopril?

230
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,184
Clonadine.

231
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:55,787
You could use Labetalol,
you could use Hydralazine,

232
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:58,631
but any emergency
department that you go to,

233
00:13:58,631 --> 00:13:59,938
it's Clonadine.

234
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:03,576
Okay, this patient, this
one's a little bit easier

235
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,131
but I just wanted to
bring this up to discuss,

236
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:07,878
so we'll take a look at it.

237
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:46,412
What would you guys
wanna do with this one?

238
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:50,365
Okay, Berkeley said it
increases the Amlodipine,

239
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:51,944
and that's exactly right.

240
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:56,112
So I just want it to stress the point that

241
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:58,411
if they're not titrated to the maximum

242
00:14:58,411 --> 00:15:00,098
therapeutic effective dose--

243
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:01,857
- That's the first thing you wanna do

244
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,317
before you add a third agent in this case.

245
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,450
Because he's already on lisinopril 40.

246
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,400
So from 40 to 80 you're not gonna see

247
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,813
too much of a clinical change.

248
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:15,206
So 40's kinda max therapeutic dose.

249
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,482
Amlodipine we can go all the way up to 10,

250
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:19,554
and he was only on 2.5,

251
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:21,261
and his blood pressure wasn't that high

252
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:24,268
that we were worried about
any hypertensive urgency

253
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:25,589
or emergency.

254
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:27,986
So that's a perfectly fine answer.

255
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:30,351
And then if he comes back
and it's still elevated,

256
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,013
I would titrate again.

257
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,848
So once he was on amlodapine 10

258
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:39,666
and lisinopril 40, and
it was still elevated,

259
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,983
what would you guys do?

260
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:43,526
So we'll go back to him.

261
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,805
I think I heard thiazide diuretic.

262
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:54,805
Yeah, okay, and that's right.

263
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:56,614
So you always wanna go back and think

264
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:59,682
what the guidelines say are
gonna be our first line agent.

265
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:01,552
And he's already on an ACE,

266
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:03,075
so it's ACE or ARB,

267
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:06,599
you don't want somebody
on an ACE and an ARB.

268
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,910
So he's already on that ACE,

269
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,637
already on the calcium channel blocker,

270
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:12,258
then you would just do a
thiazide-like diuretic.

271
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:15,581
And you can HCTZ, or chlorthalidone.

272
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,649
They're both proven. Yes, sir.

273
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:28,082
Yeah, I don't know why that's on there.

274
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:36,019
I don't know why the
calcium level's on there.

275
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,259
Don't worry about that for this case,

276
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,297
but yeah, you would wanna look at that.

277
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:45,832
Okay, so now this same patient

278
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:48,312
is having swelling in his legs,

279
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:49,652
and you examine him,

280
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:52,960
and he is having +1
pitting peripheral edema.

281
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,907
So why do you think that would be?

282
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,075
Okay, so Barclay thinks it's from

283
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:09,371
the calcium channel blocker, and I agree.

284
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:11,981
And you may see that

285
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,215
when you initiate a
calcium channel blocker,

286
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:19,040
or when you increase dose with
a calcium channel blocker.

287
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,409
What main side effects are we
worried about besides cough

288
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,486
with ACE inhibitors?

289
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:27,928
Edema, yep.

290
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:31,382
So, same thing, just in the lips usually.

291
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,338
Lips, tongue, face.

292
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:38,330
What about a main side effect

293
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,491
with our thiazide-like diuretics?

294
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:42,796
We kinda talked about that.

295
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,081
Hypercalcemia, and then the hypokalemia.

296
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,573
So really, electrolytes we wanna monitor.

297
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:52,258
And then what other side effects

298
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:53,375
do we wanna counsel on

299
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,110
with the thiazide-like diuretics?

300
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:58,815
Urination, okay.

301
00:17:58,815 --> 00:17:59,992
So yeah, you always wanna tell them

302
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,131
to take it in the morning,

303
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:04,468
you may have increased urinary frequency.

304
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,770
So now we have a 50-year-old male

305
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,598
who has hypertension.

306
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:36,382
He has a past medical history of MI.

307
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,514
So what medication would somebody

308
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:40,506
that has had a past medical history of MI

309
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:41,710
need to be on?

310
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,223
A beta blocker.

311
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,333
So I think sometimes people
get confused with that too.

312
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,462
No, beta blockers are not
first line for hypertension

313
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,391
per JNC 8 guidelines.

314
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:55,601
But if you have a patient
that's had heart failure

315
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,186
or previous MI,

316
00:18:57,186 --> 00:19:00,152
you're going to want them
to be on a beta blocker.

317
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:02,490
And that beta blocker
will serve two purposes.

318
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,654
It will help them with
their other problem,

319
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:08,707
and it will lower their blood pressure.

320
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:09,743
So that's a good thing.

321
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:11,937
So that's the one time that
the rule doesn't apply,

322
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:14,188
that it's not first line for hypertension.

323
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:19,871
Now the physician has decided,

324
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:22,024
okay they're on a beta blocker,

325
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:24,260
and they're on an ACE inhibitor,

326
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,106
I wanna add a diuretic.

327
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:29,790
And we know the sodium's
141, so that's fine,

328
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,146
potassium's 3.7, fine.

329
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:35,961
Creatinine clearance is
just a little bit low, 47.4.

330
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:41,061
So what diuretic would you think to add?

331
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:46,541
Chlorthalidone, okay.
That's a fine choice.

332
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,024
So if you look at the diuretics,

333
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,956
you don't wanna use HCTZ
when they get below 30,

334
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,496
but our patient's above 30 right now.

335
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,930
What other diuretics
are options in general

336
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,620
in hypertension, or for
treatment of other things?

337
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,111
What diuretics do we have?

338
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:08,669
Okay, so we have loop
diuretics, so furosemide.

339
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:11,190
I just wanna make it clear that usually

340
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,614
you're not going to use
furosemide to treat hypertension,

341
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:17,675
as the treatment of hypertension.

342
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:21,638
So they'll be put on it
for peripheral edema,

343
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,698
potentially from heart failure,

344
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:26,341
and then they might be on it PRN.

345
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:28,655
It will help with
lowering of blood pressure

346
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:30,686
if they're on it for something else,

347
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:32,250
but you wanna make sure
that you understand

348
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,506
that you don't put them on
it as a first line agent

349
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:35,924
for hypertension.

350
00:20:36,976 --> 00:20:38,546
What else? What other diuretics?

351
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,347
Okay, potassium-sparing,

352
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:47,703
so we have spironolactone and eplerenone.

353
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:50,289
When would you use
those with hypertension?

354
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,215
Okay, so if they've had heart failure

355
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,166
it's a good option.

356
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,512
Also if they're resistant hypertension.

357
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:02,158
So if they're kind of on everything

358
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:04,190
that's first line already,

359
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,521
sometimes they're gonna have elevated ADH,

360
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:11,057
so aldosterone, and that's
a good option for them.

361
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:12,988
What are we worried about with

362
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,127
those potassium-sparing diuretics?

363
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:23,106
Okay, so potassium too
high, that's a good point.

364
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:23,878
So you always wanna make sure

365
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:26,112
you check their potassium
before you start them,

366
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:27,982
and then about a month
after you start them.

367
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:31,070
Same thing with ACEs and ARBs,
but this is even more so.

368
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,129
And what about main side effects?

369
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,649
Gynecomastia, yep.

370
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:41,218
Eplerenone has less gynecomastia

371
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,824
than spirinolactone.

372
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:45,567
So if your patient's
insurance is gonna cover it,

373
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,078
usually that's a little
bit better of an option.

374
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:50,473
Again, not first line in hypertension,

375
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:53,785
but if it's treatment
resistant, you can use it.

376
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,960
There's also triamterene you might see,

377
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,402
not first line,

378
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,002
but especially some of the
more old school doctors

379
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:05,062
will put them on triamterene, HCTZ.

380
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,093
And then I put this question in,

381
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,872
is MJ adequately beta blocked?

382
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:13,950
So let's take a look at the pulse here,

383
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,338
what do you guys think?

384
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:21,109
How do you tell if somebody's
adequately beta blocked?

385
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,539
Okay, I'm hearing 60-80 normal limits.

386
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:29,844
Any other guesses?

387
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,925
Usually about 60 to 70

388
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:39,509
is gonna mean that they're kind of

389
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,460
maximally adequately beta blocked.

390
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,285
60 to 80, I would agree with as well

391
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:47,170
if it's kind of on the
lower end of normal,

392
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,801
all the way down to 60.

393
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:51,457
Anything below 60

394
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:54,079
you're gonna kinda start
to worry a little bit,

395
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,420
but that's how you tell.

396
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,832
So if a patient, even if they're on

397
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:02,378
maximum dose atenolol,
maximum dose metoprolol,

398
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:04,694
if their pulse is still over 90

399
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:05,771
that means that beta blocker

400
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:08,270
is not adequately
working for that patient.

401
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,602
So you always wanna take
a look at that as well.

402
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:14,192
Okay, these I just put for your benefit,

403
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,812
I'm not reading through these.

404
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:20,194
Basically goal is gonna
be less than 140/90

405
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:21,048
as we've stated,

406
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:23,506
for the most part, for most diseases.

407
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:26,086
And then you have to go to
the individual guidelines

408
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:28,384
for each disease state.

409
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:30,657
So CKD guidelines for CKD,

410
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:33,563
which is actually now in
conjunction with the 140/90.

411
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:34,700
But it used to be different.

412
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,427
Diabetes used to be different,

413
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:38,053
now they're all kinda
getting on board together,

414
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:39,125
so that's good.

415
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:42,227
Then I just put in some basic slides,

416
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:43,649
I'm not redoing your IT slides,

417
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:45,946
you guys have already
had hypertension and IT.

418
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:49,745
But main medications used,

419
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:52,203
main side effects,

420
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,337
so our ACEs and our ARBs,

421
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:57,323
of course we wanna look out for cough,

422
00:23:57,323 --> 00:23:59,334
and then elevated potassium.

423
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,498
And the edema like we talked about.

424
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:03,022
Calcium channel blockers,

425
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:05,156
when would you use a non-dihydropyridine

426
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:07,467
calcium channel blocker for hypertension?

427
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:13,643
Or would you use the non-dihydropyridine?

428
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:18,346
Not too sure?

429
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:20,897
Maybe some people are
sure, but I can't hear you.

430
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:24,790
The main difference is gonna be

431
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,173
that these act centrally, right,

432
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,574
they're gonna act on the heart.

433
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:29,464
So if it's an afib patient

434
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:31,353
that's trying to be rate-controlled,

435
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:32,959
hopefully you guys know,

436
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,823
I think you guys had
an afib case last week,

437
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:38,087
that these are gonna be your
calcium channel blockers

438
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:39,408
that you're going to.

439
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:42,598
If your patient also has hypertension,

440
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:44,909
that's when you would use that medication.

441
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:47,382
And then your dihyrdopyridines

442
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:48,743
are gonna act more peripherally

443
00:24:48,743 --> 00:24:52,208
to vasodilate, and then reduce
your blood pressure that way.

444
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,362
So these are gonna be
when we're talking about

445
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:57,491
first line hypertension medicines,

446
00:24:57,491 --> 00:24:59,482
and we say calcium channel blockers,

447
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:01,900
these are the medicines
that we're talking about.

448
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,073
Not so much these unless there's another

449
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:05,759
comorphic condition that indicates

450
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,346
that you would use
verapamil and diltiazem.

451
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:16,156
Beta blockers, again,

452
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:18,198
you wanna make sure

453
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:20,479
that your patient has another indication.

454
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,390
It wouldn't be your first choice to start

455
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,273
unless they're having
repeatedly high pulse

456
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,371
for unknown reason.

457
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:27,997
And in that case you
would definitely wanna

458
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:29,480
go ahead an get an EKG

459
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,176
to make sure something
else isn't going on.

460
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:34,528
But previous MI, or CHF,

461
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:36,296
that's when you would use these,

462
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:39,323
and you want to make
sure that you start low

463
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:40,359
and go slow.

464
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,781
That's how I learned beta blockers.

465
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:44,564
So start at a low dose and then titrate.

466
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:47,207
And same thing when you
discontinue beta blockers.

467
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,933
So you don't just wanna
stop a beta blocker,

468
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:51,209
you wanna decrease the dose

469
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:54,723
and titrate back down until
you stop the beta blocker.

470
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:56,836
Then once you have titrated down,

471
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:58,463
then you can start your new agent

472
00:25:58,463 --> 00:25:59,823
if the purpose of titrating

473
00:25:59,823 --> 00:26:01,557
is that you're switching agents.

474
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,780
You also wanna make sure,

475
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,629
because a lot of our hypertension patients

476
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:08,437
may also have diabetes,

477
00:26:08,437 --> 00:26:10,043
so if they are on a beta blocker

478
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:11,627
it's important to tell them that

479
00:26:11,627 --> 00:26:13,498
it might mask the signs and symptoms

480
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:15,264
of hypoglycemia.

481
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:17,191
All of them besides, what?

482
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:21,721
What won't a beta blocker mask?

483
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:26,266
Sweating.

484
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:31,153
So it'll mask the palpitations,
dizziness feeling,

485
00:26:31,153 --> 00:26:33,307
but they'll still have the sweating

486
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:34,878
if they have the sweating.

487
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,645
Okay, that kind of does that.

488
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:40,875
So any major questions on hypertension?

489
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:43,562
I tried to kinda cover
through different cases.

490
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:47,915
Nope, okay.

491
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:50,211
Well, hopefully that helps to distinguish

492
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:51,762
a little bit in your head.

493
00:26:52,751 --> 00:26:54,545
So now let's go on to dyslipidemia.

494
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:57,673
Let you guys read through that.

495
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:23,263
So we have a 45-year-old

496
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,244
Caucasian male who has type 2 diabetes.

497
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:32,247
And blood pressure's 135/86,

498
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:33,953
so just a little bit elevated.

499
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,066
Total cholesterol is 210.

500
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,271
What's our goal here?

501
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:39,774
200.

502
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:43,208
HDL is 37. What's our goal for men?

503
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,205
Over 40. And women?

504
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:45,957
50.

505
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,478
LDL is 170. What's our goal here?

506
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,804
100, so he's a diabetic patient.

507
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:55,815
And then it's controversial,

508
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:58,274
but the guidelines actually say

509
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:00,549
cardiovascular issues as well,

510
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:02,627
you can push to less than 70.

511
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,752
Triglycerides are 320,
what's our goal here?

512
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,611
Less than 150.

513
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:12,628
At what point do we worry
about triglycerides?

514
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:13,817
500, good.

515
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,316
Man, you guys are good today.

516
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:19,217
And A1C's just a little bit high at 7.2.

517
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,848
Overweight, 210 at 5'6.

518
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:24,778
Smokes two packs a day,

519
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:28,313
and somebody calculated their
ASCVD 10 year risk score

520
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:30,707
at 8.5%.

521
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:34,770
So what medicine would you want to start?

522
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:38,015
High-intensity statin, okay.

523
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:39,830
And which statins are those?

524
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:42,891
Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, yep.

525
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,314
Lipitor and Crestor, okay.

526
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:47,666
And certain doses, so Crestor either dose,

527
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:50,348
but then atorvastatin is
gonna be the 40 to 80.

528
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,304
20 is actually a moderate intensity.

529
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,785
There we go.

530
00:28:57,794 --> 00:29:00,497
So you wanna look at the age, 40 to 75,

531
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:03,057
diabetes, ASCVD risk,

532
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:04,804
and then you'll start a statin.

533
00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:06,470
What labs do you wanna get

534
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,081
when you start a statin?

535
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:12,124
I heard CPK. What else?

536
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,177
I heard ALT. Let's go with both.

537
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:19,554
Liver function test, so AST, ALT.

538
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:21,972
And then you would ideally have

539
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:23,568
a lipid panel as well.

540
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:25,981
But CPK, and then your LFTs.

541
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:29,917
Now, you only monitor your CPK, LFTs

542
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:31,684
when clinically indicated.

543
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:35,504
So if your patient is having
signs or symptoms, or issues.

544
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:36,987
It's not something you're gonna get

545
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:38,853
every time you get a lipid panel.

546
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:44,921
So now this patient's
a 35-year-old female.

547
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,636
Would your choice of therapy be different,

548
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:50,593
and if yes, what would it be?

549
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:06,064
- Who says yes, they'd change therapy?

550
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:09,559
Who says no?

551
00:30:11,564 --> 00:30:13,605
The other 50 of you
aren't paying attention.

552
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,057
(laughing)

553
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:17,423
35 year old female.

554
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,098
What I wanted to stress with this

555
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:22,211
is can a 35 year old female get pregnant?

556
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:26,812
Yes, and statins are what?

557
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:28,258
Category X.

558
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:30,764
Just something you always
want to think about

559
00:30:30,764 --> 00:30:32,427
if you're in a retail pharmacy

560
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:36,424
and you see a female that
could potentially be pregnant,

561
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:38,342
you always just want to make sure

562
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:40,242
that they're either using contraception

563
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:42,061
or are at least aware of the fact

564
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:44,397
that it's pregnancy category X.

565
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:47,426
It's something doctors
forget to say a lot.

566
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:52,421
In that case, let's say
she's trying to get pregnant.

567
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:55,261
What would you recommend?

568
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:06,282
Okay, lifestyle changes is
a perfectly reasonable ...

569
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,738
Fish oil isn't going to hurt.

570
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:11,236
Really that's probably it for now.

571
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,431
Mostly, as long as cholesterol,

572
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:16,158
triglycerides aren't over 500

573
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:18,738
and cholesterol isn't
in a dangerous level,

574
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:21,124
then you could just do
therapeutic lifestyle changes

575
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:24,241
until after the pregnancy
and breastfeeding.

576
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:27,912
I'll let you guys read through this one.

577
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:57,238
We have a 38 year old male

578
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:58,863
who's on simvastatin 20

579
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:01,954
and gemfibrozil 600 twice a day.

580
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:05,517
LDL is 110, so just slightly elevated.

581
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:07,307
HDL is 38

582
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:10,268
and triglycerides are 240.

583
00:32:10,268 --> 00:32:12,417
AST/ALT normal.

584
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:17,441
What would you want to do in
this patient at this time?

585
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:31,605
Barkley's question is if you can take

586
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:34,629
simvastatin 20 milligrams and gemfibrozil?

587
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:37,130
The answer is no and that's
the point of this question.

588
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,466
You can, yes.

589
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:39,883
That's the highest dose you can take,

590
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:42,699
but ideally you would
just want to discontinue

591
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:45,612
the simvastatin if the
patient's on gemfibrozil,

592
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:48,154
pick a more lipophilic statin.

593
00:32:48,154 --> 00:32:50,451
Pravastatin is always a good option.

594
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:53,178
Less interactions with 3A4.

595
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:56,274
Of course you want to tell
him to avoid grapefruit juice.

596
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,018
Pravastatin, atorvastatin
is also another fine choice.

597
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,724
It has less interactions,

598
00:33:00,724 --> 00:33:02,563
and if that patient needed that

599
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,773
because pravastatin you
can only increase so high

600
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:06,825
and only moderate intensity.

601
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:09,691
If the patient is eventually
going to need a high intensity,

602
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:12,272
atorvastatin would be a good choice.

603
00:33:12,272 --> 00:33:14,321
The main point here is that you want to

604
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:16,240
note that interaction.

605
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,713
Also another good option would just be

606
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:21,598
to switch to fenofibrate, Tricor.

607
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:24,110
It has some interaction but not as much.

608
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,023
Knowing that interaction
is very important.

609
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:35,070
Hydrophilic, sorry.

610
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,948
Pravastatin's going to be your best option

611
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,239
but then you have to think about

612
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:40,652
as high as you can titrate it.

613
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,130
Thank you.

614
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:58,313
Now we have a 64 year old
female who comes to clinic.

615
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:00,847
Hypertension, diabetes, and GERD.

616
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:03,976
On Lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide.

617
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:07,260
LDL is 178, so pretty high.

618
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,428
Triglycerides, 200

619
00:34:09,428 --> 00:34:12,379
and HDL slightly low at 39.

620
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:15,826
Her 10 year ASCVD is 7.2.

621
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:19,472
What would you recommend for this patient?

622
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:39,739
She's less than 7.5% right now,

623
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,354
something you would definitely
want to continue monitoring.

624
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:44,284
Moderate intensity was fine.

625
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:45,920
I think you could also argue

626
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,979
that you would initiate a high intensity,

627
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:50,442
that she's close and a little bit older

628
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:52,786
and has comorbidities.

629
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,263
Clinically you could argue

630
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:56,064
but the black and white per the guidelines

631
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,527
would be that she's less than 7.5.

632
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:02,337
Then you always want to
reevaluate their lipid panel.

633
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:04,961
Guidelines say four to 12 weeks.

634
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:07,589
I usually go with right
around six to eight weeks,

635
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:10,006
but if your patient also has diabetes,

636
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:12,220
it's going to make sense
to go ahead and get the A1C

637
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,060
and the lipid panel at the same time,

638
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,942
which might be in that 12 week time frame.

639
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:21,775
Again, you don't need to
get the LFTs or CPK again

640
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:24,247
unless clinically indicated.

641
00:35:26,131 --> 00:35:29,828
Now this patient comes
back and has muscle pain

642
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,180
and is feeling fatigued.

643
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,430
What would you recommend?

644
00:35:47,694 --> 00:35:50,838
I heard a few different things
and they're all correct.

645
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:52,356
There's a few options.

646
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:54,866
You can stop what medication they're on,

647
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:57,876
see if the symptoms go
away, and rechallenge.

648
00:35:57,876 --> 00:36:00,296
Alternatively you could lower the dose

649
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:02,397
and see if symptoms go away.

650
00:36:02,397 --> 00:36:05,016
I have a lot of patients
that are on atorvastatin 80

651
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:07,208
who will have muscle cramps,

652
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,584
atorvastatin 40 they go away.

653
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,145
Yes, sir?

654
00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:16,174
Two to four weeks.

655
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,719
Wait until the symptoms
resolve, if they resolve.

656
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,399
If they don't resolve, it's
something else going on.

657
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,034
I'd give it two to four weeks

658
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:24,590
and then you could rechallenge.

659
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,743
Hopefully it's not a disease state

660
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:30,651
where you're worried about
immediate harm to the patient

661
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:33,137
so you have that wiggle room.

662
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:35,098
That's a good question.

663
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:40,603
You could stop it, decrease the dose,

664
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:42,860
or you can switch to another statin.

665
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,183
Simvastatin is notorious for
having more muscle cramps

666
00:36:46,183 --> 00:36:50,804
and muscle pains than let's
say atorvastatin or Crestor.

667
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:53,639
You can always try and
switch to another statin.

668
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,072
There's three good options.

669
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:56,807
All of them are correct.

670
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,567
I think that's happening in
your guys' case this week

671
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:03,378
if I understood correctly.

672
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:13,047
Now this patient's having muscle pains

673
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:16,387
and tells you they're
having dark colored urine.

674
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:19,474
What would you recommend
for this patient to do?

675
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,013
Guesses?

676
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,389
This would be rhabdomyolysis, right?

677
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:33,186
That's what we're worried about.

678
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:36,707
Dark colored urine,
almost Coca-Cola looking.

679
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,010
What is that from?

680
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:46,999
It's actually the muscle breakdown,

681
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:48,935
so it's the protein in the urine

682
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,664
and they need to go
straight to the hospital

683
00:37:50,664 --> 00:37:52,305
is the answer to that.

684
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:54,395
It's nothing you can do outpatient.

685
00:37:54,395 --> 00:37:56,394
They need to stop the statin first of all

686
00:37:56,394 --> 00:37:58,240
and then go to the hospital.

687
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,487
All they do to treat
rhabdo is fluids mostly

688
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:06,495
and then monitoring of
course for clearing up.

689
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:09,136
That's not something that
can be treated outpatient

690
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:11,514
by just drinking water
and stopping the statin.

691
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:12,580
It's very serious.

692
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,640
You want to make sure you know to

693
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,018
recommend to go to the hospital.

694
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:19,327
Okay.

695
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:23,776
Next we have a 53 year old female

696
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:27,154
who was started on Niaspan

697
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:31,430
and she wants to know a little
bit more about this medicine.

698
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,000
What could you tell her
about this medicine?

699
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:41,769
Anybody?

700
00:38:44,816 --> 00:38:47,478
Okay, extended release would be good.

701
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:49,353
Why is that ...

702
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:54,575
Okay, so less to the liver, and what else?

703
00:38:56,012 --> 00:38:57,323
Flushing, yeah.

704
00:38:57,323 --> 00:39:00,355
That's a big counseling
point with this one.

705
00:39:02,135 --> 00:39:04,420
Flushing, itching, red face,

706
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,430
and then you want to
worry about the liver too.

707
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,975
It can also cause hyperglycemia
and hyperuricemia.

708
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:14,131
You want to take it with
food and avoid spicy foods

709
00:39:14,131 --> 00:39:16,173
and hot beverages.

710
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:20,472
Flushing might diminish,

711
00:39:20,472 --> 00:39:24,309
and then you can actually
pre-treat about 30 minutes before

712
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:27,270
with Aspirin or ibuprofen

713
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,375
30 to 60 minutes before,

714
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:32,338
and that should reduce
some of the flushing.

715
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:36,733
Now, what do the guidelines
say about niacin use

716
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:38,912
or Niaspan use?

717
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:45,201
Okay, so Barkley said
the AIM-HIGH trial said

718
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:47,461
it doesn't show benefits,
which is correct.

719
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:50,988
The guidelines actually don't
necessarily recommend it,

720
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,653
but you will still see patients on it.

721
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:55,572
There are still studies that show

722
00:39:55,572 --> 00:39:57,366
that there is some benefit.

723
00:39:57,366 --> 00:40:01,568
It increases HDL and decreases
triglycerides a little bit.

724
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,161
Mostly benefit is increasing the HDL.

725
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:07,715
Some physicians will add
it on after statin therapy,

726
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:09,517
they'll go ahead and add this on.

727
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,517
It's important just to
know how to counsel on it,

728
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:14,348
main side effects and then
worrying about the liver

729
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:16,451
and the flushing are going
to be the two main things

730
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:19,212
you want to take home about this one.

731
00:40:38,442 --> 00:40:40,613
Now we have a 52 year old female

732
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:44,379
who has a history of hypertriglyceridemia.

733
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:48,353
She's on Lopid 600 twice a day.

734
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:52,560
Triglycerides are still
high, even on the max dose.

735
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,354
She wants to take something more natural.

736
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:59,169
What could you recommend that
would help with triglycerides?

737
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:01,381
Fish oil, yes.

738
00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:04,685
You have to look at the ...

739
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,046
I can't think of the things right now.

740
00:41:08,046 --> 00:41:10,361
DPA FHA content.

741
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:12,734
Lovaza, it's already built in for you.

742
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:14,749
They're going to take one gram.

743
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:16,240
The over the counter ones,

744
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,025
they might be taking as many
as two pills twice a day,

745
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:21,969
depending on the content.

746
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:26,522
It's important over the counter
products, you look at that.

747
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,150
Any omega-3 fatty acids.

748
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,947
The best are going to
be the prescribed ones

749
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,080
because it already has the
correct amount in there.

750
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,428
Now we have a 55 year old female

751
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:42,376
with five year history of hypertension.

752
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:46,356
She smokes and doesn't
drink or use illicit drugs.

753
00:41:46,356 --> 00:41:48,615
Total cholesterol is 180.

754
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:50,460
LDL is 131.

755
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,223
HDL is 35.

756
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:54,704
Triglycerides, 195.

757
00:41:54,704 --> 00:41:57,286
What would you recommend?

758
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:11,796
Any guesses?

759
00:42:15,797 --> 00:42:17,476
Moderate intensity, yes.

760
00:42:17,476 --> 00:42:20,267
You would want to calculate,

761
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:22,461
well I guess that was (mumbling)

762
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:26,243
You'd want to calculate the ASCVD risk.

763
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,505
Being 55, I maybe should
have made this person

764
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:34,446
a little bit younger
with no smoking history.

765
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,921
If the ASCVD risk was below the 7.5

766
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:41,724
and the only other
comorbidity was hypertension,

767
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:46,278
you might want to try
lifestyle recommendations first

768
00:42:46,278 --> 00:42:48,767
and then go on.

769
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:52,001
If we're going to tell a
hypercholesterolemia patient

770
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:54,049
to do lifestyle modifications,

771
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:57,442
what modifications are we talking about?

772
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:59,610
The same exercise,

773
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,266
but it's a little bit
different than the DASH diet

774
00:43:02,266 --> 00:43:04,811
when we're talking about cholesterol.

775
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:10,053
Low fat?

776
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:11,347
Okay, very good.

777
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:13,170
Yeah, that's going to be the main focus.

778
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,903
You want to go over what
foods have fats in them.

779
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:19,910
A lot of people don't
think about the cheese

780
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,571
and the fried foods.

781
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:25,242
Maybe some of the healthier fats even,

782
00:43:25,242 --> 00:43:27,448
like in cheese, they don't realize.

783
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:29,518
You want to make sure that
you talk about those with them

784
00:43:29,518 --> 00:43:30,822
and then the same thing,

785
00:43:30,822 --> 00:43:34,312
exercise, lowering alcohol content.

786
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:37,004
Alcohol's tricky because
it can actually increase

787
00:43:37,004 --> 00:43:38,273
HDL slightly,

788
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:40,148
but that's still not
something we want to recommend

789
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:42,472
to our patient.

790
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:46,196
Just in general, same
lifestyle modifications.

791
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:50,711
I'll let you read through this.

792
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:20,605
Now we have a 48 year old male.

793
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:24,220
Dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, DVT.

794
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,474
Doctor wants to initiate Welchol,

795
00:44:27,474 --> 00:44:30,870
which is a bile acid sequestrant.

796
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,421
LDL is high, 160 so it might
be time to add something else

797
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:39,387
if we can't titrate the atorvastatin.

798
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:41,719
Triglycerides, 320.

799
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,427
HDL, 42.

800
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:46,311
Total cholesterol, 199.

801
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:50,413
Would you guys initiate
Welchol at this time?

802
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:53,001
Let's say we can't
titrate the atorvastatin.

803
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:58,719
Yes?

804
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:04,862
- (mumbling) Most the class.

805
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:06,544
Nothing.

806
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:09,354
Okay, so Welchol actually you want to get

807
00:45:09,354 --> 00:45:12,420
baseline lipids because
you can't initiate it

808
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,288
with triglycerides over 300.

809
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:18,782
So that's why that's important.

810
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,649
For the most part, you're not going to use

811
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:23,902
a bile acid sequestrant in the treatment

812
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:26,201
of dyslipidemia in general.

813
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:28,523
Statins are going to be our first line.

814
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:32,029
After that we can add on Zetia.

815
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,661
We can add on the new PCSK9 inhibitors,

816
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:38,670
which I'll talk about in a minute.

817
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,152
Niacin, fish oil, and then I would say

818
00:45:42,152 --> 00:45:44,558
very last line would be
a bile acid sequestrant.

819
00:45:44,558 --> 00:45:45,810
Yes?

820
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:51,080
Say it one more time, sorry?

821
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:57,285
Besides the statin?

822
00:45:57,285 --> 00:45:59,665
Fish oil probably.

823
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:04,665
I mean, dyslipidemia is kind
of easy because it's statins

824
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:06,991
for the most part.

825
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:09,604
Welchol can be used and I have used it

826
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:13,852
in patients that are,
can't tolerate statins,

827
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:16,012
can't afford Zetia,

828
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:17,452
then you can use something like this.

829
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:19,542
It does have LDL benefit.

830
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:22,074
It's hard to take

831
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:24,708
and then you can't use it
if triglycerides are high

832
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,821
so it's a more difficult drug to use

833
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:28,864
but it's kind of there for an option

834
00:46:28,864 --> 00:46:31,848
if all your other options are not,

835
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:34,182
if you're not able to
use your other options.

836
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:38,304
So again, don't want to use the face line.

837
00:46:38,304 --> 00:46:40,497
Trigylcerides are over 300.

838
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,378
Discontinue if they get over 400,

839
00:46:42,378 --> 00:46:45,130
because we don't want them to be over 500

840
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,994
and then have to treat
that with another drug.

841
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:52,945
And the most common one is, well,

842
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:55,592
Cholestyramine as well, but
Welchol or Cholestyramine

843
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:59,632
are going to be the most
common ones you see.

844
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:01,733
Lab values, you guys
already told me these.

845
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:03,562
It sounds like you know them very well,

846
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:05,148
so these are just here for you.

847
00:47:05,148 --> 00:47:09,792
Less than 200, and these come
from our ATP3 guidelines.

848
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:11,974
I think, especially your
class might be the class

849
00:47:11,974 --> 00:47:13,669
that's going to be the
most confused because

850
00:47:13,669 --> 00:47:17,071
they came out with guidelines
while you were in school

851
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:19,648
and nobody knows how to use them.

852
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:21,077
Like, providers don't
know how to use them.

853
00:47:21,077 --> 00:47:22,610
Physicians don't know how to use them

854
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,549
because the new guidelines don't even have

855
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:26,267
cholesterol goals in them.

856
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:29,634
So what most practitioners
are doing is merging

857
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:32,276
the ATP3 guidlelines, or the goals,

858
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:35,295
with the new guidelines, so there's still,

859
00:47:35,295 --> 00:47:37,117
the other guidelines just basically say,

860
00:47:37,117 --> 00:47:40,205
"Start a moderate
intensity statin," the end.

861
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:42,260
Like, there's no need to reach a goal.

862
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,824
But most practitioners are using these and

863
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:48,343
I would assume that the
NAPLEX is what they'll test

864
00:47:48,343 --> 00:47:50,943
you on as well and you know those.

865
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:53,586
And if Capstone tests
you, it'll be on this.

866
00:47:56,064 --> 00:48:00,117
Okay, so in general,
clinical ISDVD patients

867
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:01,824
need to be initiated on statins.

868
00:48:01,824 --> 00:48:05,480
Patients with an LDL over 190

869
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,115
and that's just with no comorbidities,

870
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:11,878
if they have diabetes and are 40 to 75,

871
00:48:11,878 --> 00:48:14,420
with an LDL between 70 to 189,

872
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,998
they need to be started,
so basically over 70,

873
00:48:16,998 --> 00:48:20,724
70 to 189, and then the
rest captures the 190.

874
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:25,264
Also 40 to 75 with an
LDL between 70 to 189

875
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:29,174
and the 10 year ASCVD risk over 7.5.

876
00:48:30,422 --> 00:48:34,659
So that's when you would start a statin.

877
00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:37,724
Of course, contraindicate in
pregnancy like we talked about.

878
00:48:37,724 --> 00:48:40,023
Anybody with active liver
disease, you're not going

879
00:48:40,023 --> 00:48:42,309
to want to start a statin.

880
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:44,701
And if they have history of
liver disease, I'd be cautious

881
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:46,802
to start a statin if
there's another option

882
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:48,301
that you can use.

883
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,681
If you are going to start
one, that's when it would be

884
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:53,270
clinically indicated to
check the AST and ALT

885
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:56,068
more frequently when
you pull a lipid panel

886
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:58,168
and I do have patients
that have liver disease

887
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:01,025
that are on statins that do fine on them.

888
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:03,597
It's just I do check their LFTs.

889
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:09,362
Lipid panel, again, four to
12 weeks after initiation,

890
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:11,324
then every three to 12 months.

891
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:14,318
Usually once they're at
goal on a statin and they're

892
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,663
kind of good, I'll just
bump them to once a year

893
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,008
and make sure that it's
still good once a year.

894
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,647
So high intensity, we have Atorvastatin,

895
00:49:24,647 --> 00:49:28,328
40 to 80, and then the
Crestor, moderate intensity

896
00:49:28,328 --> 00:49:32,900
Simvastatin, 20 to 40,
80 we don't use any more.

897
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,358
And then Atorvastatin,
10 to 20 and low dose

898
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:38,457
Rosuvastatin and then low intensity,

899
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:40,199
where there's actually,
there's other ones,

900
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:42,451
Pravastatin, 80 milligrams is moderate

901
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:44,402
intensity as well.

902
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:48,871
Low intensity, there's no real
indication per the guidelines

903
00:49:48,871 --> 00:49:50,323
for low intensity statins.

904
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:52,110
They either recommend
high intensity or moderate

905
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,527
intensity.

906
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:55,605
Clinically you might see Pravastatin

907
00:49:55,605 --> 00:49:59,428
or Lovastatin because
they're the cheapest.

908
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:01,566
They're the cheapest and then Pravastatin,

909
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:04,062
if there's going to be interactions,

910
00:50:04,062 --> 00:50:05,525
that's the best one to go to.

911
00:50:05,525 --> 00:50:09,315
So you could do Pravastatin,
40 to 80 milligrams as well.

912
00:50:11,085 --> 00:50:13,628
Main side effects, of
course the myopathy's

913
00:50:13,628 --> 00:50:17,911
and myalgia's, elevated
liver enzymes and rabdo,

914
00:50:17,911 --> 00:50:19,746
and we talked about all those things.

915
00:50:19,746 --> 00:50:22,625
So what to do if they're
having myopathy's,

916
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:24,506
if they're having Rhabdomyolysis.

917
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:27,079
Hopefully no one has
any questions on that.

918
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:31,995
Next the fibric acid derivatives, again,

919
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,106
Gemfibrozil has that
interaction with statins,

920
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:37,405
particularly Simvastatin.

921
00:50:37,405 --> 00:50:41,329
You want to make sure to try
and avoid that if possible.

922
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,745
And Fenofibrate's also another option.

923
00:50:43,745 --> 00:50:47,081
It's a more expensive option,
though, if cost is an issue.

924
00:50:49,072 --> 00:50:50,884
And then you want to make sure that you

925
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:54,501
same monitoring parameters,
monitor lipid panels.

926
00:50:56,468 --> 00:50:57,966
So I talked a little bit about this,

927
00:50:57,966 --> 00:50:59,464
but I want to talk some more about it,

928
00:50:59,464 --> 00:51:01,287
just so that everybody's clear.

929
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:05,490
So Zetia is usually an add-on
therapy after you've kind of

930
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:10,490
maxed out statins or if the
patient cannot tolerate statins.

931
00:51:10,574 --> 00:51:13,826
So statin plus Zetia or Zetia
if they can't tolerate statins

932
00:51:13,826 --> 00:51:15,422
at all.

933
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:19,573
It has shown benefit, so it
does have a place in therapy.

934
00:51:19,573 --> 00:51:22,126
It's just kind of an add-on
therapy after we've tried that.

935
00:51:22,126 --> 00:51:26,242
PCSK9 inhibitors, did your
class have this in IT?

936
00:51:27,526 --> 00:51:29,232
Or update? Okay.

937
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:31,810
So pretty new class of drugs,

938
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,331
the monoclonic antibodies.

939
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:35,189
There's four of them now.

940
00:51:35,189 --> 00:51:37,428
There might have only been
two when you had it in IT,

941
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,506
but there's four now.

942
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:40,865
I couldn't even tell you
all the names off the top

943
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:43,071
of my head because they're
new and I don't use them

944
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:44,069
in practice.

945
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:46,172
Praluent, they have weird names,

946
00:51:46,172 --> 00:51:50,572
but these are for the

947
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:54,634
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

948
00:51:54,634 --> 00:51:58,453
That's what they're FDA indicated for.

949
00:51:58,453 --> 00:52:03,453
They also have an indication
if they're on the maximum

950
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:06,778
statin dose, you can add
one of these on as well.

951
00:52:06,778 --> 00:52:09,483
They're very expensive
agents at this point.

952
00:52:09,483 --> 00:52:12,757
I don't think many
practitioners are utilizing them

953
00:52:12,757 --> 00:52:15,741
frequently unless they have that familial

954
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:18,563
hypercholesterolemia, but
it is an option and it is

955
00:52:18,563 --> 00:52:20,920
FDA approved, so you should
know about those drugs

956
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,158
and then niacin I think
we covered pretty well

957
00:52:24,158 --> 00:52:27,514
but again, it's going to increase the HDL,

958
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:29,604
lower the triglycerides.

959
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,484
Aim-High trial said
there's no real benefit.

960
00:52:32,484 --> 00:52:37,383
Other studies kind of differ with that.

961
00:52:37,383 --> 00:52:40,111
It's not in the guidelines
but you might see it used,

962
00:52:40,111 --> 00:52:43,768
so if you do see it used, you
want to think about the liver

963
00:52:43,768 --> 00:52:46,683
function test and the flushing,

964
00:52:46,683 --> 00:52:48,192
so red flushing.

965
00:52:48,192 --> 00:52:51,245
If they do have that, you can
give aspirin or ibuprofen,

966
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:53,376
30 to 60 minutes ahead of time.

967
00:52:54,786 --> 00:52:56,278
Okay, any questions on that?

968
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:00,091
So let's take like really
just a five minute break

969
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:02,258
because there's not much
of the lecture left.

970
00:53:03,622 --> 00:53:06,444
That being said, let's
talk about obesity briefly.

971
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:10,227
So obesity's very
straightforward, very simple,

972
00:53:10,227 --> 00:53:12,642
but just a refresher on some of the drugs,

973
00:53:12,642 --> 00:53:14,553
when you should use them, et cetera.

974
00:53:16,044 --> 00:53:18,361
So I'll let you read
through that real quick.

975
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:52,187
So we have a 31 year old male, 194 pounds,

976
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:57,109
five foot five, doesn't
exercise, eats a lot of fast food

977
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:00,406
because he's in pharmacy school.

978
00:54:00,406 --> 00:54:02,508
He's noticed some weight
around his abdomen

979
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:06,003
over the last few months, smokes, drinks.

980
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:09,817
So, calculate a BMI for him.

981
00:54:11,888 --> 00:54:14,019
Hopefully you guys
remember how to do this.

982
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:46,620
Does anybody have one?

983
00:55:05,085 --> 00:55:07,033
31.4, anyone get anything different?

984
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:08,943
I don't know if I, okay.

985
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:14,974
I have 29, but I could have
typed something in wrong.

986
00:55:14,974 --> 00:55:16,692
So let's go with 29.

987
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:18,851
So this is just a refresher.

988
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:21,894
Underweight's going to be less than 18.5.

989
00:55:21,894 --> 00:55:25,040
Normal is 18.5 to 24.9.

990
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,710
Overweight's 25 to 29.9.

991
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:32,285
Obese starts at 30,
technically, to 34.9 and

992
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:36,441
then they classify severely
obese as a separate thing,

993
00:55:36,441 --> 00:55:39,889
35 to 39.9 and then anything over 40

994
00:55:39,889 --> 00:55:41,805
is going to be morbidly
obese, and that's when

995
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,591
bariatric surgery can
be considered and we'll

996
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,995
go through that in just a minute.

997
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:49,633
So let's say their BMI's 29.

998
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:52,373
That's going to put him as overweight.

999
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:54,841
So what would you start at this point?

1000
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,572
I heard a diet and exercise
and that's accurate.

1001
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:03,810
So pharmacotherapy is not
indicated until their BMI's

1002
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:08,810
over 30 and I'd like to
say that the guidelines,

1003
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:11,066
I think sometimes students get confused.

1004
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:13,910
It's not if you're BMI's over
30 you automatically start

1005
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,812
on a pharmacotherapy agent.

1006
00:56:16,812 --> 00:56:19,204
Pharmacotherapy agents
for obesity are only going

1007
00:56:19,204 --> 00:56:22,815
to decrease you by about
three to six kilograms,

1008
00:56:22,815 --> 00:56:26,054
which is approximately
more or less five to 10%

1009
00:56:26,054 --> 00:56:27,424
of body weight.

1010
00:56:27,424 --> 00:56:30,211
Those should only be
initiated after trying diet

1011
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:34,646
and exercise lifestyle
changes for about six months

1012
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:38,384
with no improvement seen
and then the BMI's over 30

1013
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:40,253
and they have comorbidities,
then you can start

1014
00:56:40,253 --> 00:56:42,808
a pharmacotherapy agent,
but it's not something

1015
00:56:42,808 --> 00:56:44,955
if you're reading a patient
case or if when you're out

1016
00:56:44,955 --> 00:56:48,067
on rotations you see a
patient has a BMI over 30,

1017
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:51,747
we're going to put everybody
in the world on Orlistat

1018
00:56:51,747 --> 00:56:53,071
or something like that.

1019
00:56:53,071 --> 00:56:56,449
If that was the case,
most people in America

1020
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:58,446
would be walking around on
some type of anti-obesity

1021
00:56:58,446 --> 00:56:59,932
medicine, right?

1022
00:56:59,932 --> 00:57:00,908
So that's just not the case.

1023
00:57:00,908 --> 00:57:02,707
So I want to make sure that that's clear,

1024
00:57:02,707 --> 00:57:04,634
that when you do see your Capstone cases,

1025
00:57:04,634 --> 00:57:07,084
you're not trying to start
people on that right away.

1026
00:57:07,084 --> 00:57:08,744
First line's always, always going to be

1027
00:57:08,744 --> 00:57:11,560
lifestyle recommendations.

1028
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:15,814
So, smoking cessation counseling.

1029
00:57:15,814 --> 00:57:20,192
Again, exercising at least three
times a week for 30 minutes

1030
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:23,466
ideally five times a week for 30 minutes,

1031
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:25,869
sometimes it's hard to
get patients to start off

1032
00:57:25,869 --> 00:57:28,690
exercising five times a
week, 30 minutes a day.

1033
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,710
So it's okay to stay,
"Let's start two days a week

1034
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:33,787
"or three days a week" and
then increase from there.

1035
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:36,166
Also that 30 minutes can
be broken up into 10 minute

1036
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:37,165
increments.

1037
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:39,812
They did a study with that,
so if you want to exercise

1038
00:57:39,812 --> 00:57:42,587
10 minutes before work,
10 minutes at lunch,

1039
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:46,128
and then 10 minutes after
work, that's you're 30 minutes.

1040
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:48,067
Technically.

1041
00:57:48,067 --> 00:57:52,734
So healthy diet, more or
less 1500 kilocals per day.

1042
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:56,067
Three meals per day with two
snacks is the healthiest way

1043
00:57:56,067 --> 00:57:58,226
to eat and again, watching your calories,

1044
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:01,872
watching your carbohydrates.

1045
00:58:01,872 --> 00:58:04,368
Increase raw foods, fruits
and vegetables are going

1046
00:58:04,368 --> 00:58:05,354
to be the healthiest.

1047
00:58:05,354 --> 00:58:07,827
The same things that we
talked about with the TLC diet

1048
00:58:07,827 --> 00:58:09,255
and the dash diet.

1049
00:58:09,255 --> 00:58:11,392
Same principles apply to obesity.

1050
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:15,989
And then increase protein
and decrease fats and

1051
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:17,818
carbohydrates.

1052
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,674
So now read through that real quick.

1053
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,847
So now he comes back and his BMI's higher.

1054
00:58:47,847 --> 00:58:52,189
So now it's 33, which is over
30, like we talked about.

1055
00:58:52,189 --> 00:58:55,544
His waist circumference is 42.

1056
00:58:55,544 --> 00:58:57,971
Do you know what the cutoff
is we're looking for men

1057
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:00,130
for waist circumference?

1058
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,429
40, mm-hmm, so he's over that.

1059
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:07,131
Not eating healthy, not exercising,

1060
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:09,964
and now he has hypertension
and dyslipidemia,

1061
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:13,408
so we have some comorbidities.

1062
00:59:13,408 --> 00:59:16,391
What's an appropriate
treatment option at this point?

1063
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:20,851
BELVIQ, okay.

1064
00:59:20,851 --> 00:59:24,369
So we could start a pharmacotherapy agent.

1065
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:28,882
Other complications, this should
be pretty straightforward.

1066
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:32,608
I mean, we could have
diabetes, heart issues,

1067
00:59:32,608 --> 00:59:35,383
brain issues, kidney issues, liver issues,

1068
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:37,647
a lot of things come along with obesity.

1069
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:41,647
And is bariatric surgery
an option at this point?

1070
00:59:42,697 --> 00:59:43,464
No.

1071
00:59:43,464 --> 00:59:47,340
Only over 40 and that still
has to be heavily considered

1072
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:50,604
if they have a lot of
comorbidities, high cardiovascular

1073
00:59:50,604 --> 00:59:54,307
risk, and then it's a complicated process.

1074
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:56,479
They have to decrease the
amount of food they eat

1075
00:59:56,479 --> 00:59:59,602
ahead of time and afterwards,
so really that's reserved

1076
00:59:59,602 --> 01:00:00,428
for very

1077
01:00:00,428 --> 01:00:04,986
- The last line, um, patients.

1078
01:00:04,986 --> 01:00:07,823
So there's a few different options.

1079
01:00:07,823 --> 01:00:10,904
The Orlistat, so Alli if
it's over the counter,

1080
01:00:10,904 --> 01:00:15,904
Xenical, um, Belviq is an option.

1081
01:00:16,103 --> 01:00:17,179
And then I just put some of the,

1082
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:19,375
um, the ADR's here.

1083
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:22,749
So headache, dizziness,
potential hypoglycemia.

1084
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:25,636
Qsymia is a newer medicine,

1085
01:00:25,636 --> 01:00:28,355
so the Phentermine and Topiramate.

1086
01:00:28,355 --> 01:00:31,406
Um, and same type of symptoms,

1087
01:00:31,406 --> 01:00:34,380
dizziness, headache, insomnia.

1088
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,485
And then we want to talk about

1089
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:41,029
healthy diet and exercise, as we said.

1090
01:00:41,029 --> 01:00:42,429
Other complications...

1091
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:44,616
Oh I forgot to mention
arthritis is a huge one.

1092
01:00:44,616 --> 01:00:47,992
I actually had a patient in
this morning before I came here,

1093
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:50,391
she was 419 pounds, and
was just complaining

1094
01:00:50,391 --> 01:00:53,284
that all her joints hurt,
and she's on Diclofenac,

1095
01:00:53,284 --> 01:00:55,349
and she's tried all these NSAIDS,

1096
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:57,153
and when it comes down to it,

1097
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,032
I mean, she's having arthritic
pain from being 420 pounds,

1098
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,585
so, um, really that's gonna
be your first time option,

1099
01:01:02,585 --> 01:01:03,691
is to lose the weight.

1100
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:08,113
Sleep apnea, so people
with large neck radiuses.

1101
01:01:09,343 --> 01:01:12,944
Depression goes hand in hand, usually.

1102
01:01:12,944 --> 01:01:15,955
And no to the bariatric surgery.

1103
01:01:17,689 --> 01:01:22,095
So let's say this patient
was a 31 year old female,

1104
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,995
would there be any weight loss medications

1105
01:01:23,995 --> 01:01:26,493
you would not want to give her?

1106
01:01:30,606 --> 01:01:32,193
The same thing with our Statins, right?

1107
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:35,702
What are we thinking about
with a 31 year old female?

1108
01:01:35,702 --> 01:01:37,584
Pregnancy, yep.

1109
01:01:56,429 --> 01:01:57,813
OK, we lost that one.

1110
01:01:57,813 --> 01:02:00,833
Um, Belviq you shouldn't use, sorry.

1111
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,418
I don't know where that slide went.

1112
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,898
Um, in pregnant patients.

1113
01:02:06,537 --> 01:02:08,659
So again, it depends on the BMI,

1114
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:11,983
but pregnant patients, if...

1115
01:02:11,983 --> 01:02:15,895
If the obesity is not a severe
extreme, immediate issue,

1116
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:18,024
I would just do lifestyle modification,

1117
01:02:18,024 --> 01:02:20,726
and then worry about pharmacotherapy

1118
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:23,907
after the baby, after they've
lost some of the baby weight.

1119
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,069
If they're pregnant.

1120
01:02:27,939 --> 01:02:30,403
OK, so this patient was started on Belviq,

1121
01:02:30,403 --> 01:02:32,377
10 milligrams twice a day,

1122
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:35,230
he's been eating healthy and exercising,

1123
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:36,348
and he's kind of concerned that

1124
01:02:36,348 --> 01:02:38,550
he hasn't lost a lot of weight.

1125
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,130
So he's lost some, 194 to 188.

1126
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,053
What would you recommend?

1127
01:02:57,164 --> 01:02:59,582
OK, so 150 minutes a week exercise,

1128
01:02:59,582 --> 01:03:01,529
that's one point.

1129
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:05,300
What about the medicine?

1130
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,482
Would you keep him on
the same medicine, no?

1131
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:09,146
I have one no.

1132
01:03:09,146 --> 01:03:11,175
Would you switch the medicine?

1133
01:03:13,845 --> 01:03:14,988
One yes.

1134
01:03:16,078 --> 01:03:19,174
OK, um, so after three months,

1135
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:23,662
you want to reevaluate about
five percent of the body weight

1136
01:03:23,662 --> 01:03:27,499
you can initiate a different
agent at that point.

1137
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:30,719
If that's still a route
you want to pursue.

1138
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:32,603
Um, if they've kind of come down,

1139
01:03:32,603 --> 01:03:34,569
their BMI's down less than 30,

1140
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:38,661
you might just want to try,
trial DC-ing it altogether.

1141
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:46,357
So some general recommendations
from the guidelines,

1142
01:03:46,357 --> 01:03:48,321
they are very straightforward.

1143
01:03:48,321 --> 01:03:51,246
Um, calculate the BMI,

1144
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:53,353
you know, you're worried
about risk for CVD,

1145
01:03:53,353 --> 01:03:57,735
diabetes, um, measuring
waist circumference.

1146
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:01,093
Three to five percent of weight loss

1147
01:04:01,093 --> 01:04:03,916
results in clinically
meaningful reductions

1148
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:05,928
in a lot of things, so your sugars,

1149
01:04:05,928 --> 01:04:08,426
your triglycerides, your blood pressure,

1150
01:04:08,426 --> 01:04:09,142
and it really does.

1151
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:12,289
I've seen patients just lose,
you know, 10 to 20 pounds,

1152
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:14,293
and all of a sudden their blood
pressure is under control,

1153
01:04:14,293 --> 01:04:15,846
sugars are under control.

1154
01:04:15,846 --> 01:04:18,241
It's amazing, watching it happen.

1155
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:20,711
Um, weight loss diet,

1156
01:04:20,711 --> 01:04:23,582
so for women about 1200 to 1500,

1157
01:04:23,582 --> 01:04:26,949
for men 1500 to 1800.

1158
01:04:26,949 --> 01:04:29,855
Stupid men, get extra calories.

1159
01:04:29,855 --> 01:04:33,349
Um... (laughs)

1160
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:35,834
That's my own thought,
not in the guidelines.

1161
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:40,304
Um, let's see.

1162
01:04:40,304 --> 01:04:42,468
OK, and again, um,

1163
01:04:42,468 --> 01:04:45,052
bariatric surgery is only for BMI over 40,

1164
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:48,198
or over 35 with comoribid conditions,

1165
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:50,023
who haven't responded to pharmacotherapy

1166
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:52,729
or other treatment options.

1167
01:04:52,729 --> 01:04:55,135
And then...

1168
01:04:56,061 --> 01:04:58,648
I just made this chart so you can see, um,

1169
01:04:58,648 --> 01:05:00,800
the main dosage and side effects.

1170
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,776
You guys can read through that.

1171
01:05:01,776 --> 01:05:06,155
But I did want to show
you, I liked one slide.

1172
01:05:10,334 --> 01:05:13,823
So, some conditions that
you might want to consider

1173
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:16,206
starting different
obesity medications with.

1174
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:20,409
So CVD or uncontrolled, hypertension, um,

1175
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:22,493
you might want to lean more towards

1176
01:05:22,493 --> 01:05:25,787
the Lorcaserin or Orlistat.

1177
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:28,941
Depression, possibly
maybe lean more towards

1178
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:30,746
the Bupropion and Naltrexone,

1179
01:05:30,746 --> 01:05:33,727
because of that Bupropion agent.

1180
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:37,184
Um, migrane, possibly
Phentermine Topiramate

1181
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:39,444
because of the Topiramate component.

1182
01:05:39,444 --> 01:05:42,973
Seizure, if the patient
has a history of seizures,

1183
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:43,926
you might want to make sure that

1184
01:05:43,926 --> 01:05:46,215
you avoid the Bupropion
just like you would

1185
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:49,387
smoking cessation, or depression.

1186
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:52,466
And possible first choice,
Phentermine or Topiramate,

1187
01:05:52,466 --> 01:05:54,880
again from that Topiramate component.

1188
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,774
So, if you just kind of are clueless,

1189
01:05:56,774 --> 01:05:59,295
and the patient has one
of these other conditions,

1190
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,563
you could consider starting
one of these agents,

1191
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:02,309
because of that.

1192
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:03,161
Yes?

1193
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:13,270
Do smoking cessation with this product?

1194
01:06:18,492 --> 01:06:19,599
Oh, yeah.

1195
01:06:21,653 --> 01:06:23,498
Yeah, if you're using it...

1196
01:06:23,498 --> 01:06:26,162
Yes, if you're using it
for the obesity first,

1197
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:28,551
and you also want them to
have smoking cessation,

1198
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,944
you definitely can use that product,

1199
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,096
because it has that Bupropion
in it, yes, good point.

1200
01:06:33,096 --> 01:06:35,912
Does anyone have any questions on obesity?

1201
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:38,202
It's really stratightforward, but...

1202
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:41,917
Hypertension questions,
dyslipidemia questions?

1203
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:43,797
OK, hopefully that was helpful.

1204
01:06:43,797 --> 01:06:45,516
Have a good day, guys.
