1
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:01,857
- That's the first thing you wanna do

2
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,317
before you add a third agent in this case.

3
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:06,450
Because he's already on lisinopril 40.

4
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,400
So from 40 to 80 you're not gonna see

5
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,813
too much of a clinical change.

6
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:15,206
So 40's kinda max therapeutic dose.

7
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,482
Amlodipine we can go all the way up to 10,

8
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:19,554
and he was only on 2.5,

9
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:21,261
and his blood pressure wasn't that high

10
00:15:21,261 --> 00:15:24,268
that we were worried about
any hypertensive urgency

11
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:25,589
or emergency.

12
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:27,986
So that's a perfectly fine answer.

13
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:30,351
And then if he comes back
and it's still elevated,

14
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,013
I would titrate again.

15
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,848
So once he was on amlodapine 10

16
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:39,666
and lisinopril 40, and
it was still elevated,

17
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:40,983
what would you guys do?

18
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:43,526
So we'll go back to him.

19
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,805
I think I heard thiazide diuretic.

20
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:54,805
Yeah, okay, and that's right.

21
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:56,614
So you always wanna go back and think

22
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:59,682
what the guidelines say are
gonna be our first line agent.

23
00:15:59,682 --> 00:16:01,552
And he's already on an ACE,

24
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:03,075
so it's ACE or ARB,

25
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:06,599
you don't want somebody
on an ACE and an ARB.

26
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,910
So he's already on that ACE,

27
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,637
already on the calcium channel blocker,

28
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:12,258
then you would just do a
thiazide-like diuretic.

29
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:15,581
And you can HCTZ, or chlorthalidone.

30
00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:17,649
They're both proven. Yes, sir.

31
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:28,082
Yeah, I don't know why that's on there.

32
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:36,019
I don't know why the
calcium level's on there.

33
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,259
Don't worry about that for this case,

34
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,297
but yeah, you would wanna look at that.

35
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:45,832
Okay, so now this same patient

36
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:48,312
is having swelling in his legs,

37
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:49,652
and you examine him,

38
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:52,960
and he is having +1
pitting peripheral edema.

39
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,907
So why do you think that would be?

40
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,075
Okay, so Barclay thinks it's from

41
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:09,371
the calcium channel blocker, and I agree.

42
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:11,981
And you may see that

43
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,215
when you initiate a
calcium channel blocker,

44
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:19,040
or when you increase dose with
a calcium channel blocker.

45
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,409
What main side effects are we
worried about besides cough

46
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,486
with ACE inhibitors?

47
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:27,928
Edema, yep.

48
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:31,382
So, same thing, just in the lips usually.

49
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:33,338
Lips, tongue, face.

50
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:38,330
What about a main side effect

51
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,491
with our thiazide-like diuretics?

52
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:42,796
We kinda talked about that.

53
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,081
Hypercalcemia, and then the hypokalemia.

54
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,573
So really, electrolytes we wanna monitor.

55
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:52,258
And then what other side effects

56
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:53,375
do we wanna counsel on

57
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,110
with the thiazide-like diuretics?

58
00:17:57,134 --> 00:17:58,815
Urination, okay.

59
00:17:58,815 --> 00:17:59,992
So yeah, you always wanna tell them

60
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:01,131
to take it in the morning,

61
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:04,468
you may have increased urinary frequency.

62
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,770
So now we have a 50-year-old male

63
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,598
who has hypertension.

64
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:36,382
He has a past medical history of MI.

65
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:38,514
So what medication would somebody

66
00:18:38,514 --> 00:18:40,506
that has had a past medical history of MI

67
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:41,710
need to be on?

68
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,223
A beta blocker.

69
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,333
So I think sometimes people
get confused with that too.

70
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,462
No, beta blockers are not
first line for hypertension

71
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,391
per JNC 8 guidelines.

72
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:55,601
But if you have a patient
that's had heart failure

73
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,186
or previous MI,

74
00:18:57,186 --> 00:19:00,152
you're going to want them
to be on a beta blocker.

75
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:02,490
And that beta blocker
will serve two purposes.

76
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,654
It will help them with
their other problem,

77
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:08,707
and it will lower their blood pressure.

78
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:09,743
So that's a good thing.

79
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:11,937
So that's the one time that
the rule doesn't apply,

80
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:14,188
that it's not first line for hypertension.

81
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:19,871
Now the physician has decided,

82
00:19:19,871 --> 00:19:22,024
okay they're on a beta blocker,

83
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:24,260
and they're on an ACE inhibitor,

84
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,106
I wanna add a diuretic.

85
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:29,790
And we know the sodium's
141, so that's fine,

86
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,146
potassium's 3.7, fine.

87
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:35,961
Creatinine clearance is
just a little bit low, 47.4.

88
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:41,061
So what diuretic would you think to add?

89
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:46,541
Chlorthalidone, okay.
That's a fine choice.

90
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,024
So if you look at the diuretics,

91
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,956
you don't wanna use HCTZ
when they get below 30,

92
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,496
but our patient's above 30 right now.

93
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,930
What other diuretics
are options in general

94
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,620
in hypertension, or for
treatment of other things?

95
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,111
What diuretics do we have?

96
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:08,669
Okay, so we have loop
diuretics, so furosemide.

97
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:11,190
I just wanna make it clear that usually

98
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,614
you're not going to use
furosemide to treat hypertension,

99
00:20:15,602 --> 00:20:17,675
as the treatment of hypertension.

100
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:21,638
So they'll be put on it
for peripheral edema,

101
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,698
potentially from heart failure,

102
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:26,341
and then they might be on it PRN.

103
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:28,655
It will help with
lowering of blood pressure

104
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:30,686
if they're on it for something else,

105
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:32,250
but you wanna make sure
that you understand

106
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,506
that you don't put them on
it as a first line agent

107
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:35,924
for hypertension.

108
00:20:36,976 --> 00:20:38,546
What else? What other diuretics?

109
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,347
Okay, potassium-sparing,

110
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:47,703
so we have spironolactone and eplerenone.

111
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:50,289
When would you use
those with hypertension?

112
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,215
Okay, so if they've had heart failure

113
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:58,166
it's a good option.

114
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,512
Also if they're resistant hypertension.

115
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:02,158
So if they're kind of on everything

116
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:04,190
that's first line already,

117
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,521
sometimes they're gonna have elevated ADH,

118
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:11,057
so aldosterone, and that's
a good option for them.

119
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:12,988
What are we worried about with

120
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,127
those potassium-sparing diuretics?

121
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:23,106
Okay, so potassium too
high, that's a good point.

122
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:23,878
So you always wanna make sure

123
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:26,112
you check their potassium
before you start them,

124
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:27,982
and then about a month
after you start them.

125
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:31,070
Same thing with ACEs and ARBs,
but this is even more so.

126
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,129
And what about main side effects?

127
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,649
Gynecomastia, yep.

128
00:21:38,638 --> 00:21:41,218
Eplerenone has less gynecomastia

129
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,824
than spirinolactone.

130
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:45,567
So if your patient's
insurance is gonna cover it,

131
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,078
usually that's a little
bit better of an option.

132
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:50,473
Again, not first line in hypertension,

133
00:21:50,473 --> 00:21:53,785
but if it's treatment
resistant, you can use it.

134
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,960
There's also triamterene you might see,

135
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,402
not first line,

136
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:02,002
but especially some of the
more old school doctors

137
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:05,062
will put them on triamterene, HCTZ.

138
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,093
And then I put this question in,

139
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,872
is MJ adequately beta blocked?

140
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:13,950
So let's take a look at the pulse here,

141
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,338
what do you guys think?

142
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:21,109
How do you tell if somebody's
adequately beta blocked?

143
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,539
Okay, I'm hearing 60-80 normal limits.

144
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:29,844
Any other guesses?

145
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,925
Usually about 60 to 70

146
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:39,509
is gonna mean that they're kind of

147
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,460
maximally adequately beta blocked.

148
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,285
60 to 80, I would agree with as well

149
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:47,170
if it's kind of on the
lower end of normal,

150
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,801
all the way down to 60.

151
00:22:50,014 --> 00:22:51,457
Anything below 60

152
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:54,079
you're gonna kinda start
to worry a little bit,

153
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,420
but that's how you tell.

154
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,832
So if a patient, even if they're on

155
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:02,378
maximum dose atenolol,
maximum dose metoprolol,

156
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:04,694
if their pulse is still over 90

157
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:05,771
that means that beta blocker

158
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:08,270
is not adequately
working for that patient.

159
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,602
So you always wanna take
a look at that as well.

160
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:14,192
Okay, these I just put for your benefit,

161
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,812
I'm not reading through these.

162
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:20,194
Basically goal is gonna
be less than 140/90

163
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:21,048
as we've stated,

164
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:23,506
for the most part, for most diseases.

165
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:26,086
And then you have to go to
the individual guidelines

166
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:28,384
for each disease state.

167
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:30,657
So CKD guidelines for CKD,

168
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:33,563
which is actually now in
conjunction with the 140/90.

169
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:34,700
But it used to be different.

170
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,427
Diabetes used to be different,

171
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:38,053
now they're all kinda
getting on board together,

172
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:39,125
so that's good.

173
00:23:40,155 --> 00:23:42,227
Then I just put in some basic slides,

174
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:43,649
I'm not redoing your IT slides,

175
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:45,946
you guys have already
had hypertension and IT.

176
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:49,745
But main medications used,

177
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:52,203
main side effects,

178
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,337
so our ACEs and our ARBs,

179
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:57,323
of course we wanna look out for cough,

180
00:23:57,323 --> 00:23:59,334
and then elevated potassium.

181
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,498
And the edema like we talked about.

182
00:24:01,498 --> 00:24:03,022
Calcium channel blockers,

183
00:24:03,022 --> 00:24:05,156
when would you use a non-dihydropyridine

184
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:07,467
calcium channel blocker for hypertension?

185
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:13,643
Or would you use the non-dihydropyridine?

186
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:18,346
Not too sure?

187
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:20,897
Maybe some people are
sure, but I can't hear you.

188
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:24,790
The main difference is gonna be

189
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,173
that these act centrally, right,

190
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,574
they're gonna act on the heart.

191
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:29,464
So if it's an afib patient

192
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:31,353
that's trying to be rate-controlled,

193
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:32,959
hopefully you guys know,

194
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,823
I think you guys had
an afib case last week,

195
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:38,087
that these are gonna be your
calcium channel blockers

196
00:24:38,087 --> 00:24:39,408
that you're going to.

197
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:42,598
If your patient also has hypertension,

198
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:44,909
that's when you would use that medication.

199
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:47,382
And then your dihyrdopyridines

200
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:48,743
are gonna act more peripherally

201
00:24:48,743 --> 00:24:52,208
to vasodilate, and then reduce
your blood pressure that way.

202
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,362
So these are gonna be
when we're talking about

203
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:57,491
first line hypertension medicines,

204
00:24:57,491 --> 00:24:59,482
and we say calcium channel blockers,

205
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:01,900
these are the medicines
that we're talking about.

206
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,073
Not so much these unless there's another

207
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:05,759
comorphic condition that indicates

208
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,346
that you would use
verapamil and diltiazem.

209
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:16,156
Beta blockers, again,

210
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:18,198
you wanna make sure

211
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:20,479
that your patient has another indication.

212
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,390
It wouldn't be your first choice to start

213
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,273
unless they're having
repeatedly high pulse

214
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,371
for unknown reason.

215
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:27,997
And in that case you
would definitely wanna

216
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:29,480
go ahead an get an EKG

217
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,176
to make sure something
else isn't going on.

218
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:34,528
But previous MI, or CHF,

219
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:36,296
that's when you would use these,

220
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:39,323
and you want to make
sure that you start low

221
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:40,359
and go slow.

222
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,781
That's how I learned beta blockers.

223
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:44,564
So start at a low dose and then titrate.

224
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:47,207
And same thing when you
discontinue beta blockers.

225
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:49,933
So you don't just wanna
stop a beta blocker,

226
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:51,209
you wanna decrease the dose

227
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:54,723
and titrate back down until
you stop the beta blocker.

228
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:56,836
Then once you have titrated down,

229
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:58,463
then you can start your new agent

230
00:25:58,463 --> 00:25:59,823
if the purpose of titrating

231
00:25:59,823 --> 00:26:01,557
is that you're switching agents.

232
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,780
You also wanna make sure,

233
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,629
because a lot of our hypertension patients

234
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:08,437
may also have diabetes,

235
00:26:08,437 --> 00:26:10,043
so if they are on a beta blocker

236
00:26:10,043 --> 00:26:11,627
it's important to tell them that

237
00:26:11,627 --> 00:26:13,498
it might mask the signs and symptoms

238
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:15,264
of hypoglycemia.

239
00:26:15,264 --> 00:26:17,191
All of them besides, what?

240
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:21,721
What won't a beta blocker mask?

241
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:26,266
Sweating.

242
00:26:26,266 --> 00:26:31,153
So it'll mask the palpitations,
dizziness feeling,

243
00:26:31,153 --> 00:26:33,307
but they'll still have the sweating

244
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:34,878
if they have the sweating.

245
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,645
Okay, that kind of does that.

246
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:40,875
So any major questions on hypertension?

247
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:43,562
I tried to kinda cover
through different cases.

248
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:47,915
Nope, okay.

249
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:50,211
Well, hopefully that helps to distinguish

250
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:51,762
a little bit in your head.

251
00:26:52,751 --> 00:26:54,545
So now let's go on to dyslipidemia.

252
00:26:56,346 --> 00:26:57,673
Let you guys read through that.

253
00:27:21,093 --> 00:27:23,263
So we have a 45-year-old

254
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,244
Caucasian male who has type 2 diabetes.

255
00:27:28,244 --> 00:27:32,247
And blood pressure's 135/86,

256
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:33,953
so just a little bit elevated.

257
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:36,066
Total cholesterol is 210.

258
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,271
What's our goal here?

259
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:39,774
200.

260
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:43,208
HDL is 37. What's our goal for men?

261
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:45,205
Over 40. And women?

262
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:45,957
50.

263
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,478
LDL is 170. What's our goal here?

264
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,804
100, so he's a diabetic patient.

265
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:55,815
And then it's controversial,

266
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:58,274
but the guidelines actually say

267
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:00,549
cardiovascular issues as well,

268
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:02,627
you can push to less than 70.

269
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,752
Triglycerides are 320,
what's our goal here?

270
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,611
Less than 150.

271
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:12,628
At what point do we worry
about triglycerides?

272
00:28:12,628 --> 00:28:13,817
500, good.

273
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,316
Man, you guys are good today.

274
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:19,217
And A1C's just a little bit high at 7.2.

275
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,848
Overweight, 210 at 5'6.

276
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:24,778
Smokes two packs a day,

277
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:28,313
and somebody calculated their
ASCVD 10 year risk score

278
00:28:28,313 --> 00:28:30,707
at 8.5%.

279
00:28:31,553 --> 00:28:34,770
So what medicine would you want to start?

280
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:38,015
High-intensity statin, okay.

281
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:39,830
And which statins are those?

282
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:42,891
Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, yep.

283
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,314
Lipitor and Crestor, okay.

284
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:47,666
And certain doses, so Crestor either dose,

285
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:50,348
but then atorvastatin is
gonna be the 40 to 80.

286
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,304
20 is actually a moderate intensity.

287
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,785
There we go.

288
00:28:57,794 --> 00:29:00,497
So you wanna look at the age, 40 to 75,

289
00:29:00,497 --> 00:29:03,057
diabetes, ASCVD risk,

290
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:04,804
and then you'll start a statin.

291
00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:06,470
What labs do you wanna get

292
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,081
when you start a statin?

293
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:12,124
I heard CPK. What else?

294
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,177
I heard ALT. Let's go with both.

295
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:19,554
Liver function test, so AST, ALT.

296
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:21,972
And then you would ideally have

297
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:23,568
a lipid panel as well.

298
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:25,981
But CPK, and then your LFTs.

299
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:29,917
Now, you only monitor your CPK, LFTs

300
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:31,684
when clinically indicated.

301
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:35,504
So if your patient is having
signs or symptoms, or issues.

302
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:36,987
It's not something you're gonna get

303
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:38,853
every time you get a lipid panel.

304
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:44,921
So now this patient's
a 35-year-old female.

305
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,636
Would your choice of therapy be different,

306
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:50,593
and if yes, what would it be?

1
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:06,064
- Who says yes, they'd change therapy?

2
00:30:07,627 --> 00:30:09,559
Who says no?

3
00:30:11,564 --> 00:30:13,605
The other 50 of you
aren't paying attention.

4
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,057
(laughing)

5
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:17,423
35 year old female.

6
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,098
What I wanted to stress with this

7
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:22,211
is can a 35 year old female get pregnant?

8
00:30:23,468 --> 00:30:26,812
Yes, and statins are what?

9
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:28,258
Category X.

10
00:30:28,258 --> 00:30:30,764
Just something you always
want to think about

11
00:30:30,764 --> 00:30:32,427
if you're in a retail pharmacy

12
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:36,424
and you see a female that
could potentially be pregnant,

13
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:38,342
you always just want to make sure

14
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:40,242
that they're either using contraception

15
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:42,061
or are at least aware of the fact

16
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:44,397
that it's pregnancy category X.

17
00:30:44,397 --> 00:30:47,426
It's something doctors
forget to say a lot.

18
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:52,421
In that case, let's say
she's trying to get pregnant.

19
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:55,261
What would you recommend?

20
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:06,282
Okay, lifestyle changes is
a perfectly reasonable ...

21
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:08,738
Fish oil isn't going to hurt.

22
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:11,236
Really that's probably it for now.

23
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,431
Mostly, as long as cholesterol,

24
00:31:13,431 --> 00:31:16,158
triglycerides aren't over 500

25
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:18,738
and cholesterol isn't
in a dangerous level,

26
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:21,124
then you could just do
therapeutic lifestyle changes

27
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:24,241
until after the pregnancy
and breastfeeding.

28
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:27,912
I'll let you guys read through this one.

29
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:57,238
We have a 38 year old male

30
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:58,863
who's on simvastatin 20

31
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:01,954
and gemfibrozil 600 twice a day.

32
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:05,517
LDL is 110, so just slightly elevated.

33
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:07,307
HDL is 38

34
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:10,268
and triglycerides are 240.

35
00:32:10,268 --> 00:32:12,417
AST/ALT normal.

36
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:17,441
What would you want to do in
this patient at this time?

37
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:31,605
Barkley's question is if you can take

38
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:34,629
simvastatin 20 milligrams and gemfibrozil?

39
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:37,130
The answer is no and that's
the point of this question.

40
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,466
You can, yes.

41
00:32:38,466 --> 00:32:39,883
That's the highest dose you can take,

42
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:42,699
but ideally you would
just want to discontinue

43
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:45,612
the simvastatin if the
patient's on gemfibrozil,

44
00:32:45,612 --> 00:32:48,154
pick a more lipophilic statin.

45
00:32:48,154 --> 00:32:50,451
Pravastatin is always a good option.

46
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:53,178
Less interactions with 3A4.

47
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:56,274
Of course you want to tell
him to avoid grapefruit juice.

48
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,018
Pravastatin, atorvastatin
is also another fine choice.

49
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,724
It has less interactions,

50
00:33:00,724 --> 00:33:02,563
and if that patient needed that

51
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,773
because pravastatin you
can only increase so high

52
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:06,825
and only moderate intensity.

53
00:33:06,825 --> 00:33:09,691
If the patient is eventually
going to need a high intensity,

54
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:12,272
atorvastatin would be a good choice.

55
00:33:12,272 --> 00:33:14,321
The main point here is that you want to

56
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:16,240
note that interaction.

57
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,713
Also another good option would just be

58
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:21,598
to switch to fenofibrate, Tricor.

59
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:24,110
It has some interaction but not as much.

60
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,023
Knowing that interaction
is very important.

61
00:33:33,259 --> 00:33:35,070
Hydrophilic, sorry.

62
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,948
Pravastatin's going to be your best option

63
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,239
but then you have to think about

64
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:40,652
as high as you can titrate it.

65
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,130
Thank you.

66
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:58,313
Now we have a 64 year old
female who comes to clinic.

67
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:00,847
Hypertension, diabetes, and GERD.

68
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:03,976
On Lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide.

69
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:07,260
LDL is 178, so pretty high.

70
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,428
Triglycerides, 200

71
00:34:09,428 --> 00:34:12,379
and HDL slightly low at 39.

72
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:15,826
Her 10 year ASCVD is 7.2.

73
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:19,472
What would you recommend for this patient?

74
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:39,739
She's less than 7.5% right now,

75
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,354
something you would definitely
want to continue monitoring.

76
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:44,284
Moderate intensity was fine.

77
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:45,920
I think you could also argue

78
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,979
that you would initiate a high intensity,

79
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:50,442
that she's close and a little bit older

80
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:52,786
and has comorbidities.

81
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,263
Clinically you could argue

82
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:56,064
but the black and white per the guidelines

83
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,527
would be that she's less than 7.5.

84
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:02,337
Then you always want to
reevaluate their lipid panel.

85
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:04,961
Guidelines say four to 12 weeks.

86
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:07,589
I usually go with right
around six to eight weeks,

87
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:10,006
but if your patient also has diabetes,

88
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:12,220
it's going to make sense
to go ahead and get the A1C

89
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,060
and the lipid panel at the same time,

90
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,942
which might be in that 12 week time frame.

91
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:21,775
Again, you don't need to
get the LFTs or CPK again

92
00:35:21,775 --> 00:35:24,247
unless clinically indicated.

93
00:35:26,131 --> 00:35:29,828
Now this patient comes
back and has muscle pain

94
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,180
and is feeling fatigued.

95
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,430
What would you recommend?

96
00:35:47,694 --> 00:35:50,838
I heard a few different things
and they're all correct.

97
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:52,356
There's a few options.

98
00:35:52,356 --> 00:35:54,866
You can stop what medication they're on,

99
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:57,876
see if the symptoms go
away, and rechallenge.

100
00:35:57,876 --> 00:36:00,296
Alternatively you could lower the dose

101
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:02,397
and see if symptoms go away.

102
00:36:02,397 --> 00:36:05,016
I have a lot of patients
that are on atorvastatin 80

103
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:07,208
who will have muscle cramps,

104
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,584
atorvastatin 40 they go away.

105
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,145
Yes, sir?

106
00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:16,174
Two to four weeks.

107
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,719
Wait until the symptoms
resolve, if they resolve.

108
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,399
If they don't resolve, it's
something else going on.

109
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:23,034
I'd give it two to four weeks

110
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:24,590
and then you could rechallenge.

111
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,743
Hopefully it's not a disease state

112
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:30,651
where you're worried about
immediate harm to the patient

113
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:33,137
so you have that wiggle room.

114
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:35,098
That's a good question.

115
00:36:38,438 --> 00:36:40,603
You could stop it, decrease the dose,

116
00:36:40,603 --> 00:36:42,860
or you can switch to another statin.

117
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,183
Simvastatin is notorious for
having more muscle cramps

118
00:36:46,183 --> 00:36:50,804
and muscle pains than let's
say atorvastatin or Crestor.

119
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:53,639
You can always try and
switch to another statin.

120
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:55,072
There's three good options.

121
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:56,807
All of them are correct.

122
00:36:57,934 --> 00:37:00,567
I think that's happening in
your guys' case this week

123
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:03,378
if I understood correctly.

124
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:13,047
Now this patient's having muscle pains

125
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:16,387
and tells you they're
having dark colored urine.

126
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:19,474
What would you recommend
for this patient to do?

127
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,013
Guesses?

128
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,389
This would be rhabdomyolysis, right?

129
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:33,186
That's what we're worried about.

130
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:36,707
Dark colored urine,
almost Coca-Cola looking.

131
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,010
What is that from?

132
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:46,999
It's actually the muscle breakdown,

133
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:48,935
so it's the protein in the urine

134
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,664
and they need to go
straight to the hospital

135
00:37:50,664 --> 00:37:52,305
is the answer to that.

136
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:54,395
It's nothing you can do outpatient.

137
00:37:54,395 --> 00:37:56,394
They need to stop the statin first of all

138
00:37:56,394 --> 00:37:58,240
and then go to the hospital.

139
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,487
All they do to treat
rhabdo is fluids mostly

140
00:38:02,487 --> 00:38:06,495
and then monitoring of
course for clearing up.

141
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:09,136
That's not something that
can be treated outpatient

142
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:11,514
by just drinking water
and stopping the statin.

143
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:12,580
It's very serious.

144
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,640
You want to make sure you know to

145
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,018
recommend to go to the hospital.

146
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:19,327
Okay.

147
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:23,776
Next we have a 53 year old female

148
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:27,154
who was started on Niaspan

149
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:31,430
and she wants to know a little
bit more about this medicine.

150
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,000
What could you tell her
about this medicine?

151
00:38:40,297 --> 00:38:41,769
Anybody?

152
00:38:44,816 --> 00:38:47,478
Okay, extended release would be good.

153
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:49,353
Why is that ...

154
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:54,575
Okay, so less to the liver, and what else?

155
00:38:56,012 --> 00:38:57,323
Flushing, yeah.

156
00:38:57,323 --> 00:39:00,355
That's a big counseling
point with this one.

157
00:39:02,135 --> 00:39:04,420
Flushing, itching, red face,

158
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,430
and then you want to
worry about the liver too.

159
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,975
It can also cause hyperglycemia
and hyperuricemia.

160
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:14,131
You want to take it with
food and avoid spicy foods

161
00:39:14,131 --> 00:39:16,173
and hot beverages.

162
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:20,472
Flushing might diminish,

163
00:39:20,472 --> 00:39:24,309
and then you can actually
pre-treat about 30 minutes before

164
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:27,270
with Aspirin or ibuprofen

165
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,375
30 to 60 minutes before,

166
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:32,338
and that should reduce
some of the flushing.

167
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:36,733
Now, what do the guidelines
say about niacin use

168
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:38,912
or Niaspan use?

169
00:39:41,526 --> 00:39:45,201
Okay, so Barkley said
the AIM-HIGH trial said

170
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:47,461
it doesn't show benefits,
which is correct.

171
00:39:47,461 --> 00:39:50,988
The guidelines actually don't
necessarily recommend it,

172
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,653
but you will still see patients on it.

173
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:55,572
There are still studies that show

174
00:39:55,572 --> 00:39:57,366
that there is some benefit.

175
00:39:57,366 --> 00:40:01,568
It increases HDL and decreases
triglycerides a little bit.

176
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,161
Mostly benefit is increasing the HDL.

177
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:07,715
Some physicians will add
it on after statin therapy,

178
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:09,517
they'll go ahead and add this on.

179
00:40:09,517 --> 00:40:11,517
It's important just to
know how to counsel on it,

180
00:40:11,517 --> 00:40:14,348
main side effects and then
worrying about the liver

181
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:16,451
and the flushing are going
to be the two main things

182
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:19,212
you want to take home about this one.

183
00:40:38,442 --> 00:40:40,613
Now we have a 52 year old female

184
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:44,379
who has a history of hypertriglyceridemia.

185
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:48,353
She's on Lopid 600 twice a day.

186
00:40:48,353 --> 00:40:52,560
Triglycerides are still
high, even on the max dose.

187
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,354
She wants to take something more natural.

188
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:59,169
What could you recommend that
would help with triglycerides?

189
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:01,381
Fish oil, yes.

190
00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:04,685
You have to look at the ...

191
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,046
I can't think of the things right now.

192
00:41:08,046 --> 00:41:10,361
DPA FHA content.

193
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:12,734
Lovaza, it's already built in for you.

194
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:14,749
They're going to take one gram.

195
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:16,240
The over the counter ones,

196
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,025
they might be taking as many
as two pills twice a day,

197
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:21,969
depending on the content.

198
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:26,522
It's important over the counter
products, you look at that.

199
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,150
Any omega-3 fatty acids.

200
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,947
The best are going to
be the prescribed ones

201
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,080
because it already has the
correct amount in there.

202
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:39,428
Now we have a 55 year old female

203
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:42,376
with five year history of hypertension.

204
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:46,356
She smokes and doesn't
drink or use illicit drugs.

205
00:41:46,356 --> 00:41:48,615
Total cholesterol is 180.

206
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:50,460
LDL is 131.

207
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,223
HDL is 35.

208
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:54,704
Triglycerides, 195.

209
00:41:54,704 --> 00:41:57,286
What would you recommend?

210
00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:11,796
Any guesses?

211
00:42:15,797 --> 00:42:17,476
Moderate intensity, yes.

212
00:42:17,476 --> 00:42:20,267
You would want to calculate,

213
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:22,461
well I guess that was (mumbling)

214
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:26,243
You'd want to calculate the ASCVD risk.

215
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,505
Being 55, I maybe should
have made this person

216
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:34,446
a little bit younger
with no smoking history.

217
00:42:35,888 --> 00:42:38,921
If the ASCVD risk was below the 7.5

218
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:41,724
and the only other
comorbidity was hypertension,

219
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:46,278
you might want to try
lifestyle recommendations first

220
00:42:46,278 --> 00:42:48,767
and then go on.

221
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:52,001
If we're going to tell a
hypercholesterolemia patient

222
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:54,049
to do lifestyle modifications,

223
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:57,442
what modifications are we talking about?

224
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:59,610
The same exercise,

225
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,266
but it's a little bit
different than the DASH diet

226
00:43:02,266 --> 00:43:04,811
when we're talking about cholesterol.

227
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:10,053
Low fat?

228
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:11,347
Okay, very good.

229
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:13,170
Yeah, that's going to be the main focus.

230
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,903
You want to go over what
foods have fats in them.

231
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:19,910
A lot of people don't
think about the cheese

232
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:22,571
and the fried foods.

233
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:25,242
Maybe some of the healthier fats even,

234
00:43:25,242 --> 00:43:27,448
like in cheese, they don't realize.

235
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:29,518
You want to make sure that
you talk about those with them

236
00:43:29,518 --> 00:43:30,822
and then the same thing,

237
00:43:30,822 --> 00:43:34,312
exercise, lowering alcohol content.

238
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:37,004
Alcohol's tricky because
it can actually increase

239
00:43:37,004 --> 00:43:38,273
HDL slightly,

240
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:40,148
but that's still not
something we want to recommend

241
00:43:40,148 --> 00:43:42,472
to our patient.

242
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:46,196
Just in general, same
lifestyle modifications.

243
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:50,711
I'll let you read through this.

244
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:20,605
Now we have a 48 year old male.

245
00:44:20,605 --> 00:44:24,220
Dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, DVT.

246
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,474
Doctor wants to initiate Welchol,

247
00:44:27,474 --> 00:44:30,870
which is a bile acid sequestrant.

248
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,421
LDL is high, 160 so it might
be time to add something else

249
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:39,387
if we can't titrate the atorvastatin.

250
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:41,719
Triglycerides, 320.

251
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,427
HDL, 42.

252
00:44:43,427 --> 00:44:46,311
Total cholesterol, 199.

253
00:44:47,802 --> 00:44:50,413
Would you guys initiate
Welchol at this time?

254
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:53,001
Let's say we can't
titrate the atorvastatin.

255
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:58,719
Yes?

1
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:04,862
- (mumbling) Most the class.

2
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:06,544
Nothing.

3
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:09,354
Okay, so Welchol actually you want to get

4
00:45:09,354 --> 00:45:12,420
baseline lipids because
you can't initiate it

5
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,288
with triglycerides over 300.

6
00:45:15,288 --> 00:45:18,782
So that's why that's important.

7
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,649
For the most part, you're not going to use

8
00:45:21,649 --> 00:45:23,902
a bile acid sequestrant in the treatment

9
00:45:23,902 --> 00:45:26,201
of dyslipidemia in general.

10
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:28,523
Statins are going to be our first line.

11
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:32,029
After that we can add on Zetia.

12
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,661
We can add on the new PCSK9 inhibitors,

13
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:38,670
which I'll talk about in a minute.

14
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,152
Niacin, fish oil, and then I would say

15
00:45:42,152 --> 00:45:44,558
very last line would be
a bile acid sequestrant.

16
00:45:44,558 --> 00:45:45,810
Yes?

17
00:45:48,926 --> 00:45:51,080
Say it one more time, sorry?

18
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:57,285
Besides the statin?

19
00:45:57,285 --> 00:45:59,665
Fish oil probably.

20
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:04,665
I mean, dyslipidemia is kind
of easy because it's statins

21
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:06,991
for the most part.

22
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:09,604
Welchol can be used and I have used it

23
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:13,852
in patients that are,
can't tolerate statins,

24
00:46:13,852 --> 00:46:16,012
can't afford Zetia,

25
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:17,452
then you can use something like this.

26
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:19,542
It does have LDL benefit.

27
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:22,074
It's hard to take

28
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:24,708
and then you can't use it
if triglycerides are high

29
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,821
so it's a more difficult drug to use

30
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:28,864
but it's kind of there for an option

31
00:46:28,864 --> 00:46:31,848
if all your other options are not,

32
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:34,182
if you're not able to
use your other options.

33
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:38,304
So again, don't want to use the face line.

34
00:46:38,304 --> 00:46:40,497
Trigylcerides are over 300.

35
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,378
Discontinue if they get over 400,

36
00:46:42,378 --> 00:46:45,130
because we don't want them to be over 500

37
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,994
and then have to treat
that with another drug.

38
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:52,945
And the most common one is, well,

39
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:55,592
Cholestyramine as well, but
Welchol or Cholestyramine

40
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:59,632
are going to be the most
common ones you see.

41
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:01,733
Lab values, you guys
already told me these.

42
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:03,562
It sounds like you know them very well,

43
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:05,148
so these are just here for you.

44
00:47:05,148 --> 00:47:09,792
Less than 200, and these come
from our ATP3 guidelines.

45
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:11,974
I think, especially your
class might be the class

46
00:47:11,974 --> 00:47:13,669
that's going to be the
most confused because

47
00:47:13,669 --> 00:47:17,071
they came out with guidelines
while you were in school

48
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:19,648
and nobody knows how to use them.

49
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:21,077
Like, providers don't
know how to use them.

50
00:47:21,077 --> 00:47:22,610
Physicians don't know how to use them

51
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,549
because the new guidelines don't even have

52
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:26,267
cholesterol goals in them.

53
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:29,634
So what most practitioners
are doing is merging

54
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:32,276
the ATP3 guidlelines, or the goals,

55
00:47:32,276 --> 00:47:35,295
with the new guidelines, so there's still,

56
00:47:35,295 --> 00:47:37,117
the other guidelines just basically say,

57
00:47:37,117 --> 00:47:40,205
"Start a moderate
intensity statin," the end.

58
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:42,260
Like, there's no need to reach a goal.

59
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,824
But most practitioners are using these and

60
00:47:45,824 --> 00:47:48,343
I would assume that the
NAPLEX is what they'll test

61
00:47:48,343 --> 00:47:50,943
you on as well and you know those.

62
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:53,586
And if Capstone tests
you, it'll be on this.

63
00:47:56,064 --> 00:48:00,117
Okay, so in general,
clinical ISDVD patients

64
00:48:00,117 --> 00:48:01,824
need to be initiated on statins.

65
00:48:01,824 --> 00:48:05,480
Patients with an LDL over 190

66
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,115
and that's just with no comorbidities,

67
00:48:08,115 --> 00:48:11,878
if they have diabetes and are 40 to 75,

68
00:48:11,878 --> 00:48:14,420
with an LDL between 70 to 189,

69
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,998
they need to be started,
so basically over 70,

70
00:48:16,998 --> 00:48:20,724
70 to 189, and then the
rest captures the 190.

71
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:25,264
Also 40 to 75 with an
LDL between 70 to 189

72
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:29,174
and the 10 year ASCVD risk over 7.5.

73
00:48:30,422 --> 00:48:34,659
So that's when you would start a statin.

74
00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:37,724
Of course, contraindicate in
pregnancy like we talked about.

75
00:48:37,724 --> 00:48:40,023
Anybody with active liver
disease, you're not going

76
00:48:40,023 --> 00:48:42,309
to want to start a statin.

77
00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:44,701
And if they have history of
liver disease, I'd be cautious

78
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:46,802
to start a statin if
there's another option

79
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:48,301
that you can use.

80
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:50,681
If you are going to start
one, that's when it would be

81
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:53,270
clinically indicated to
check the AST and ALT

82
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:56,068
more frequently when
you pull a lipid panel

83
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:58,168
and I do have patients
that have liver disease

84
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:01,025
that are on statins that do fine on them.

85
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:03,597
It's just I do check their LFTs.

86
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:09,362
Lipid panel, again, four to
12 weeks after initiation,

87
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:11,324
then every three to 12 months.

88
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:14,318
Usually once they're at
goal on a statin and they're

89
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,663
kind of good, I'll just
bump them to once a year

90
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,008
and make sure that it's
still good once a year.

91
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,647
So high intensity, we have Atorvastatin,

92
00:49:24,647 --> 00:49:28,328
40 to 80, and then the
Crestor, moderate intensity

93
00:49:28,328 --> 00:49:32,900
Simvastatin, 20 to 40,
80 we don't use any more.

94
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,358
And then Atorvastatin,
10 to 20 and low dose

95
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:38,457
Rosuvastatin and then low intensity,

96
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:40,199
where there's actually,
there's other ones,

97
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:42,451
Pravastatin, 80 milligrams is moderate

98
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:44,402
intensity as well.

99
00:49:44,402 --> 00:49:48,871
Low intensity, there's no real
indication per the guidelines

100
00:49:48,871 --> 00:49:50,323
for low intensity statins.

101
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:52,110
They either recommend
high intensity or moderate

102
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,527
intensity.

103
00:49:53,527 --> 00:49:55,605
Clinically you might see Pravastatin

104
00:49:55,605 --> 00:49:59,428
or Lovastatin because
they're the cheapest.

105
00:49:59,428 --> 00:50:01,566
They're the cheapest and then Pravastatin,

106
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:04,062
if there's going to be interactions,

107
00:50:04,062 --> 00:50:05,525
that's the best one to go to.

108
00:50:05,525 --> 00:50:09,315
So you could do Pravastatin,
40 to 80 milligrams as well.

109
00:50:11,085 --> 00:50:13,628
Main side effects, of
course the myopathy's

110
00:50:13,628 --> 00:50:17,911
and myalgia's, elevated
liver enzymes and rabdo,

111
00:50:17,911 --> 00:50:19,746
and we talked about all those things.

112
00:50:19,746 --> 00:50:22,625
So what to do if they're
having myopathy's,

113
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:24,506
if they're having Rhabdomyolysis.

114
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:27,079
Hopefully no one has
any questions on that.

115
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:31,995
Next the fibric acid derivatives, again,

116
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,106
Gemfibrozil has that
interaction with statins,

117
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:37,405
particularly Simvastatin.

118
00:50:37,405 --> 00:50:41,329
You want to make sure to try
and avoid that if possible.

119
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,745
And Fenofibrate's also another option.

120
00:50:43,745 --> 00:50:47,081
It's a more expensive option,
though, if cost is an issue.

121
00:50:49,072 --> 00:50:50,884
And then you want to make sure that you

122
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:54,501
same monitoring parameters,
monitor lipid panels.

123
00:50:56,468 --> 00:50:57,966
So I talked a little bit about this,

124
00:50:57,966 --> 00:50:59,464
but I want to talk some more about it,

125
00:50:59,464 --> 00:51:01,287
just so that everybody's clear.

126
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:05,490
So Zetia is usually an add-on
therapy after you've kind of

127
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:10,490
maxed out statins or if the
patient cannot tolerate statins.

128
00:51:10,574 --> 00:51:13,826
So statin plus Zetia or Zetia
if they can't tolerate statins

129
00:51:13,826 --> 00:51:15,422
at all.

130
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:19,573
It has shown benefit, so it
does have a place in therapy.

131
00:51:19,573 --> 00:51:22,126
It's just kind of an add-on
therapy after we've tried that.

132
00:51:22,126 --> 00:51:26,242
PCSK9 inhibitors, did your
class have this in IT?

133
00:51:27,526 --> 00:51:29,232
Or update? Okay.

134
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:31,810
So pretty new class of drugs,

135
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:33,331
the monoclonic antibodies.

136
00:51:33,331 --> 00:51:35,189
There's four of them now.

137
00:51:35,189 --> 00:51:37,428
There might have only been
two when you had it in IT,

138
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,506
but there's four now.

139
00:51:39,506 --> 00:51:40,865
I couldn't even tell you
all the names off the top

140
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:43,071
of my head because they're
new and I don't use them

141
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:44,069
in practice.

142
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:46,172
Praluent, they have weird names,

143
00:51:46,172 --> 00:51:50,572
but these are for the

144
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:54,634
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

145
00:51:54,634 --> 00:51:58,453
That's what they're FDA indicated for.

146
00:51:58,453 --> 00:52:03,453
They also have an indication
if they're on the maximum

147
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:06,778
statin dose, you can add
one of these on as well.

148
00:52:06,778 --> 00:52:09,483
They're very expensive
agents at this point.

149
00:52:09,483 --> 00:52:12,757
I don't think many
practitioners are utilizing them

150
00:52:12,757 --> 00:52:15,741
frequently unless they have that familial

151
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:18,563
hypercholesterolemia, but
it is an option and it is

152
00:52:18,563 --> 00:52:20,920
FDA approved, so you should
know about those drugs

153
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,158
and then niacin I think
we covered pretty well

154
00:52:24,158 --> 00:52:27,514
but again, it's going to increase the HDL,

155
00:52:27,514 --> 00:52:29,604
lower the triglycerides.

156
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,484
Aim-High trial said
there's no real benefit.

157
00:52:32,484 --> 00:52:37,383
Other studies kind of differ with that.

158
00:52:37,383 --> 00:52:40,111
It's not in the guidelines
but you might see it used,

159
00:52:40,111 --> 00:52:43,768
so if you do see it used, you
want to think about the liver

160
00:52:43,768 --> 00:52:46,683
function test and the flushing,

161
00:52:46,683 --> 00:52:48,192
so red flushing.

162
00:52:48,192 --> 00:52:51,245
If they do have that, you can
give aspirin or ibuprofen,

163
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:53,376
30 to 60 minutes ahead of time.

164
00:52:54,786 --> 00:52:56,278
Okay, any questions on that?

165
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:00,091
So let's take like really
just a five minute break

166
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:02,258
because there's not much
of the lecture left.

167
00:53:03,622 --> 00:53:06,444
That being said, let's
talk about obesity briefly.

168
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:10,227
So obesity's very
straightforward, very simple,

169
00:53:10,227 --> 00:53:12,642
but just a refresher on some of the drugs,

170
00:53:12,642 --> 00:53:14,553
when you should use them, et cetera.

171
00:53:16,044 --> 00:53:18,361
So I'll let you read
through that real quick.

172
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:52,187
So we have a 31 year old male, 194 pounds,

173
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:57,109
five foot five, doesn't
exercise, eats a lot of fast food

174
00:53:57,109 --> 00:54:00,406
because he's in pharmacy school.

175
00:54:00,406 --> 00:54:02,508
He's noticed some weight
around his abdomen

176
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:06,003
over the last few months, smokes, drinks.

177
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:09,817
So, calculate a BMI for him.

178
00:54:11,888 --> 00:54:14,019
Hopefully you guys
remember how to do this.

179
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:46,620
Does anybody have one?

180
00:55:05,085 --> 00:55:07,033
31.4, anyone get anything different?

181
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:08,943
I don't know if I, okay.

182
00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:14,974
I have 29, but I could have
typed something in wrong.

183
00:55:14,974 --> 00:55:16,692
So let's go with 29.

184
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:18,851
So this is just a refresher.

185
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:21,894
Underweight's going to be less than 18.5.

186
00:55:21,894 --> 00:55:25,040
Normal is 18.5 to 24.9.

187
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,710
Overweight's 25 to 29.9.

188
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:32,285
Obese starts at 30,
technically, to 34.9 and

189
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:36,441
then they classify severely
obese as a separate thing,

190
00:55:36,441 --> 00:55:39,889
35 to 39.9 and then anything over 40

191
00:55:39,889 --> 00:55:41,805
is going to be morbidly
obese, and that's when

192
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,591
bariatric surgery can
be considered and we'll

193
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,995
go through that in just a minute.

194
00:55:47,265 --> 00:55:49,633
So let's say their BMI's 29.

195
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:52,373
That's going to put him as overweight.

196
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:54,841
So what would you start at this point?

197
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,572
I heard a diet and exercise
and that's accurate.

198
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:03,810
So pharmacotherapy is not
indicated until their BMI's

199
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:08,810
over 30 and I'd like to
say that the guidelines,

200
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:11,066
I think sometimes students get confused.

201
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:13,910
It's not if you're BMI's over
30 you automatically start

202
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,812
on a pharmacotherapy agent.

203
00:56:16,812 --> 00:56:19,204
Pharmacotherapy agents
for obesity are only going

204
00:56:19,204 --> 00:56:22,815
to decrease you by about
three to six kilograms,

205
00:56:22,815 --> 00:56:26,054
which is approximately
more or less five to 10%

206
00:56:26,054 --> 00:56:27,424
of body weight.

207
00:56:27,424 --> 00:56:30,211
Those should only be
initiated after trying diet

208
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:34,646
and exercise lifestyle
changes for about six months

209
00:56:34,646 --> 00:56:38,384
with no improvement seen
and then the BMI's over 30

210
00:56:38,384 --> 00:56:40,253
and they have comorbidities,
then you can start

211
00:56:40,253 --> 00:56:42,808
a pharmacotherapy agent,
but it's not something

212
00:56:42,808 --> 00:56:44,955
if you're reading a patient
case or if when you're out

213
00:56:44,955 --> 00:56:48,067
on rotations you see a
patient has a BMI over 30,

214
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:51,747
we're going to put everybody
in the world on Orlistat

215
00:56:51,747 --> 00:56:53,071
or something like that.

216
00:56:53,071 --> 00:56:56,449
If that was the case,
most people in America

217
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:58,446
would be walking around on
some type of anti-obesity

218
00:56:58,446 --> 00:56:59,932
medicine, right?

219
00:56:59,932 --> 00:57:00,908
So that's just not the case.

220
00:57:00,908 --> 00:57:02,707
So I want to make sure that that's clear,

221
00:57:02,707 --> 00:57:04,634
that when you do see your Capstone cases,

222
00:57:04,634 --> 00:57:07,084
you're not trying to start
people on that right away.

223
00:57:07,084 --> 00:57:08,744
First line's always, always going to be

224
00:57:08,744 --> 00:57:11,560
lifestyle recommendations.

225
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:15,814
So, smoking cessation counseling.

226
00:57:15,814 --> 00:57:20,192
Again, exercising at least three
times a week for 30 minutes

227
00:57:20,192 --> 00:57:23,466
ideally five times a week for 30 minutes,

228
00:57:23,466 --> 00:57:25,869
sometimes it's hard to
get patients to start off

229
00:57:25,869 --> 00:57:28,690
exercising five times a
week, 30 minutes a day.

230
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,710
So it's okay to stay,
"Let's start two days a week

231
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:33,787
"or three days a week" and
then increase from there.

232
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:36,166
Also that 30 minutes can
be broken up into 10 minute

233
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:37,165
increments.

234
00:57:37,165 --> 00:57:39,812
They did a study with that,
so if you want to exercise

235
00:57:39,812 --> 00:57:42,587
10 minutes before work,
10 minutes at lunch,

236
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:46,128
and then 10 minutes after
work, that's you're 30 minutes.

237
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:48,067
Technically.

238
00:57:48,067 --> 00:57:52,734
So healthy diet, more or
less 1500 kilocals per day.

239
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:56,067
Three meals per day with two
snacks is the healthiest way

240
00:57:56,067 --> 00:57:58,226
to eat and again, watching your calories,

241
00:57:58,226 --> 00:58:01,872
watching your carbohydrates.

242
00:58:01,872 --> 00:58:04,368
Increase raw foods, fruits
and vegetables are going

243
00:58:04,368 --> 00:58:05,354
to be the healthiest.

244
00:58:05,354 --> 00:58:07,827
The same things that we
talked about with the TLC diet

245
00:58:07,827 --> 00:58:09,255
and the dash diet.

246
00:58:09,255 --> 00:58:11,392
Same principles apply to obesity.

247
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:15,989
And then increase protein
and decrease fats and

248
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:17,818
carbohydrates.

249
00:58:18,729 --> 00:58:20,674
So now read through that real quick.

250
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,847
So now he comes back and his BMI's higher.

251
00:58:47,847 --> 00:58:52,189
So now it's 33, which is over
30, like we talked about.

252
00:58:52,189 --> 00:58:55,544
His waist circumference is 42.

253
00:58:55,544 --> 00:58:57,971
Do you know what the cutoff
is we're looking for men

254
00:58:57,971 --> 00:59:00,130
for waist circumference?

255
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,429
40, mm-hmm, so he's over that.

256
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:07,131
Not eating healthy, not exercising,

257
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:09,964
and now he has hypertension
and dyslipidemia,

258
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:13,408
so we have some comorbidities.

259
00:59:13,408 --> 00:59:16,391
What's an appropriate
treatment option at this point?

260
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:20,851
BELVIQ, okay.

261
00:59:20,851 --> 00:59:24,369
So we could start a pharmacotherapy agent.

262
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:28,882
Other complications, this should
be pretty straightforward.

263
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:32,608
I mean, we could have
diabetes, heart issues,

264
00:59:32,608 --> 00:59:35,383
brain issues, kidney issues, liver issues,

265
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:37,647
a lot of things come along with obesity.

266
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:41,647
And is bariatric surgery
an option at this point?

267
00:59:42,697 --> 00:59:43,464
No.

268
00:59:43,464 --> 00:59:47,340
Only over 40 and that still
has to be heavily considered

269
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:50,604
if they have a lot of
comorbidities, high cardiovascular

270
00:59:50,604 --> 00:59:54,307
risk, and then it's a complicated process.

271
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:56,479
They have to decrease the
amount of food they eat

272
00:59:56,479 --> 00:59:59,602
ahead of time and afterwards,
so really that's reserved

273
00:59:59,602 --> 01:00:00,428
for very

1
01:00:00,428 --> 01:00:04,986
- The last line, um, patients.

2
01:00:04,986 --> 01:00:07,823
So there's a few different options.

3
01:00:07,823 --> 01:00:10,904
The Orlistat, so Alli if
it's over the counter,

4
01:00:10,904 --> 01:00:15,904
Xenical, um, Belviq is an option.

5
01:00:16,103 --> 01:00:17,179
And then I just put some of the,

6
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:19,375
um, the ADR's here.

7
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:22,749
So headache, dizziness,
potential hypoglycemia.

8
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:25,636
Qsymia is a newer medicine,

9
01:00:25,636 --> 01:00:28,355
so the Phentermine and Topiramate.

10
01:00:28,355 --> 01:00:31,406
Um, and same type of symptoms,

11
01:00:31,406 --> 01:00:34,380
dizziness, headache, insomnia.

12
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,485
And then we want to talk about

13
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:41,029
healthy diet and exercise, as we said.

14
01:00:41,029 --> 01:00:42,429
Other complications...

15
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:44,616
Oh I forgot to mention
arthritis is a huge one.

16
01:00:44,616 --> 01:00:47,992
I actually had a patient in
this morning before I came here,

17
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:50,391
she was 419 pounds, and
was just complaining

18
01:00:50,391 --> 01:00:53,284
that all her joints hurt,
and she's on Diclofenac,

19
01:00:53,284 --> 01:00:55,349
and she's tried all these NSAIDS,

20
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:57,153
and when it comes down to it,

21
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,032
I mean, she's having arthritic
pain from being 420 pounds,

22
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,585
so, um, really that's gonna
be your first time option,

23
01:01:02,585 --> 01:01:03,691
is to lose the weight.

24
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:08,113
Sleep apnea, so people
with large neck radiuses.

25
01:01:09,343 --> 01:01:12,944
Depression goes hand in hand, usually.

26
01:01:12,944 --> 01:01:15,955
And no to the bariatric surgery.

27
01:01:17,689 --> 01:01:22,095
So let's say this patient
was a 31 year old female,

28
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,995
would there be any weight loss medications

29
01:01:23,995 --> 01:01:26,493
you would not want to give her?

30
01:01:30,606 --> 01:01:32,193
The same thing with our Statins, right?

31
01:01:32,193 --> 01:01:35,702
What are we thinking about
with a 31 year old female?

32
01:01:35,702 --> 01:01:37,584
Pregnancy, yep.

33
01:01:56,429 --> 01:01:57,813
OK, we lost that one.

34
01:01:57,813 --> 01:02:00,833
Um, Belviq you shouldn't use, sorry.

35
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,418
I don't know where that slide went.

36
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,898
Um, in pregnant patients.

37
01:02:06,537 --> 01:02:08,659
So again, it depends on the BMI,

38
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:11,983
but pregnant patients, if...

39
01:02:11,983 --> 01:02:15,895
If the obesity is not a severe
extreme, immediate issue,

40
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:18,024
I would just do lifestyle modification,

41
01:02:18,024 --> 01:02:20,726
and then worry about pharmacotherapy

42
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:23,907
after the baby, after they've
lost some of the baby weight.

43
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,069
If they're pregnant.

44
01:02:27,939 --> 01:02:30,403
OK, so this patient was started on Belviq,

45
01:02:30,403 --> 01:02:32,377
10 milligrams twice a day,

46
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:35,230
he's been eating healthy and exercising,

47
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:36,348
and he's kind of concerned that

48
01:02:36,348 --> 01:02:38,550
he hasn't lost a lot of weight.

49
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,130
So he's lost some, 194 to 188.

50
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:45,053
What would you recommend?

51
01:02:57,164 --> 01:02:59,582
OK, so 150 minutes a week exercise,

52
01:02:59,582 --> 01:03:01,529
that's one point.

53
01:03:01,529 --> 01:03:05,300
What about the medicine?

54
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,482
Would you keep him on
the same medicine, no?

55
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:09,146
I have one no.

56
01:03:09,146 --> 01:03:11,175
Would you switch the medicine?

57
01:03:13,845 --> 01:03:14,988
One yes.

58
01:03:16,078 --> 01:03:19,174
OK, um, so after three months,

59
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:23,662
you want to reevaluate about
five percent of the body weight

60
01:03:23,662 --> 01:03:27,499
you can initiate a different
agent at that point.

61
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:30,719
If that's still a route
you want to pursue.

62
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:32,603
Um, if they've kind of come down,

63
01:03:32,603 --> 01:03:34,569
their BMI's down less than 30,

64
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:38,661
you might just want to try,
trial DC-ing it altogether.

65
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:46,357
So some general recommendations
from the guidelines,

66
01:03:46,357 --> 01:03:48,321
they are very straightforward.

67
01:03:48,321 --> 01:03:51,246
Um, calculate the BMI,

68
01:03:51,246 --> 01:03:53,353
you know, you're worried
about risk for CVD,

69
01:03:53,353 --> 01:03:57,735
diabetes, um, measuring
waist circumference.

70
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:01,093
Three to five percent of weight loss

71
01:04:01,093 --> 01:04:03,916
results in clinically
meaningful reductions

72
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:05,928
in a lot of things, so your sugars,

73
01:04:05,928 --> 01:04:08,426
your triglycerides, your blood pressure,

74
01:04:08,426 --> 01:04:09,142
and it really does.

75
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:12,289
I've seen patients just lose,
you know, 10 to 20 pounds,

76
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:14,293
and all of a sudden their blood
pressure is under control,

77
01:04:14,293 --> 01:04:15,846
sugars are under control.

78
01:04:15,846 --> 01:04:18,241
It's amazing, watching it happen.

79
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:20,711
Um, weight loss diet,

80
01:04:20,711 --> 01:04:23,582
so for women about 1200 to 1500,

81
01:04:23,582 --> 01:04:26,949
for men 1500 to 1800.

82
01:04:26,949 --> 01:04:29,855
Stupid men, get extra calories.

83
01:04:29,855 --> 01:04:33,349
Um... (laughs)

84
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:35,834
That's my own thought,
not in the guidelines.

85
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:40,304
Um, let's see.

86
01:04:40,304 --> 01:04:42,468
OK, and again, um,

87
01:04:42,468 --> 01:04:45,052
bariatric surgery is only for BMI over 40,

88
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:48,198
or over 35 with comoribid conditions,

89
01:04:48,198 --> 01:04:50,023
who haven't responded to pharmacotherapy

90
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:52,729
or other treatment options.

91
01:04:52,729 --> 01:04:55,135
And then...

92
01:04:56,061 --> 01:04:58,648
I just made this chart so you can see, um,

93
01:04:58,648 --> 01:05:00,800
the main dosage and side effects.

94
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,776
You guys can read through that.

95
01:05:01,776 --> 01:05:06,155
But I did want to show
you, I liked one slide.

96
01:05:10,334 --> 01:05:13,823
So, some conditions that
you might want to consider

97
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:16,206
starting different
obesity medications with.

98
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:20,409
So CVD or uncontrolled, hypertension, um,

99
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:22,493
you might want to lean more towards

100
01:05:22,493 --> 01:05:25,787
the Lorcaserin or Orlistat.

101
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:28,941
Depression, possibly
maybe lean more towards

102
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:30,746
the Bupropion and Naltrexone,

103
01:05:30,746 --> 01:05:33,727
because of that Bupropion agent.

104
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:37,184
Um, migrane, possibly
Phentermine Topiramate

105
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:39,444
because of the Topiramate component.

106
01:05:39,444 --> 01:05:42,973
Seizure, if the patient
has a history of seizures,

107
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:43,926
you might want to make sure that

108
01:05:43,926 --> 01:05:46,215
you avoid the Bupropion
just like you would

109
01:05:46,215 --> 01:05:49,387
smoking cessation, or depression.

110
01:05:49,387 --> 01:05:52,466
And possible first choice,
Phentermine or Topiramate,

111
01:05:52,466 --> 01:05:54,880
again from that Topiramate component.

112
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,774
So, if you just kind of are clueless,

113
01:05:56,774 --> 01:05:59,295
and the patient has one
of these other conditions,

114
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,563
you could consider starting
one of these agents,

115
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:02,309
because of that.

116
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:03,161
Yes?

117
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:13,270
Do smoking cessation with this product?

118
01:06:18,492 --> 01:06:19,599
Oh, yeah.

119
01:06:21,653 --> 01:06:23,498
Yeah, if you're using it...

120
01:06:23,498 --> 01:06:26,162
Yes, if you're using it
for the obesity first,

121
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:28,551
and you also want them to
have smoking cessation,

122
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:29,944
you definitely can use that product,

123
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:33,096
because it has that Bupropion
in it, yes, good point.

124
01:06:33,096 --> 01:06:35,912
Does anyone have any questions on obesity?

125
01:06:35,912 --> 01:06:38,202
It's really stratightforward, but...

126
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:41,917
Hypertension questions,
dyslipidemia questions?

127
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:43,797
OK, hopefully that was helpful.

128
01:06:43,797 --> 01:06:45,516
Have a good day, guys.
